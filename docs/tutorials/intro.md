# Introduction to ICU4X for Rust

`ICU4X` is an implementation of [Internationalization Components of Unicode](http://site.icu-project.org/) (ICU) intended to be modular, performant and flexible.

The library provides a layer of APIs for all software to enable internationalization capabilities.

To use `ICU4X` in the Rust ecosystem one can either add dependencies on selected components, or add a dependency on the meta-crate `icu` which brings a reasonable selection of components in the most user-friendly configuration of features.

In this tutorial we are going to build up to writing an app that uses the `icu::datetime` component to format a date and time in a Japanese locale, covering various topics in the process.

# 1. Requirements

For this tutorial we assume the user has basic Rust knowledge. If acquiring it is necessary, the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) provides an excellent introduction.
We also assume that the user is familiar with a terminal and have `rust` and `cargo` installed.

To verify that, open a terminal and check that the results are similar to:

```
$ cargo --version
cargo 1.51.0 (43b129a20 2021-03-16)
```

In this tutorial we are going to use a directory relative to the user's home directory `~/projects/icu_tutorial/`. 

# 2. Creating MyApp

To initialize a binary application, navigate to the root directory of our project and initialize a new binary app called `myapp`:

```
cd ~/projects/icu_tutorial
cargo new --bin myapp
cd myapp
```

The result is a new directory `~/projects/icu_tutorial/myapp` with a file `./src/main.rs` which is the main file for our application. For most of this tutorial we'll be working from the `myapp` folder.

# 3. Adding ICU4X as a dependency

`ICU4X`'s main meta package is called `icu`, so to start using it, all one has to do it edit their `./Cargo.toml`. The easiest way to do this is to run:

```sh
$ cargo add icu
```

which should generate:

```toml
[dependencies]
icu = "1.0"
```

After saving the changes, commands like `cargo check` will download the `icu` Rust package and use it for the build.

# 4. Locales

`ICU4X` comes with a variety of components allowing to manage various facets of software internationalization.

Most of those features depend on the selection of a `Locale` which is a particular combination of language, script, region with optional variants. An examples of such locales are `en-US` (American English), `sr-Cyrl` (Serbian with Cyrillic script) or `ar-EG-u-nu-latn` (Egyptian Arabic with ASCII numerals).

In `ICU4X` `Locale` is a part of the `locid` component. If the user needs just this one feature, they can use `icu_locid` crate as a dependency, but since here we already added a dependency on `icu`, we can refer to it via `icu::locid`.

Let's update our application to use it.

Open `./src/main.rs` and edit it to:

```rust
use icu::locid::Locale;

fn main() {
    let loc: Locale = "ES-AR".parse()
        .expect("Failed to parse locale.");

    if loc.id.language.as_str() == "es" {
        println!("Â¡Hola!");
    }

    println!("You are using: {}", loc);
}
```
*Notice:* Here, `ICU4X` canonicalized the locales's syntax which uses lowercase letters for the language portion.

After saving it, call `cargo run` in `~/projects/icu_tutorial/myapp` and it should display:

```
Â¡Hola!
You are using: es-AR
```

Congratulations! `ICU4X` has been used to semantically operate on a locale!

## Convenience macro

The scenario of working with statically declared `Locale`s is common.

It's a bit unergonomic to have to parse them at runtime and handle a parser error in such case.

For that purpose, ICU4X provides a macro one can use to parse it at compilation time:

```rust
use icu::locid::locale;

fn main() {
    let loc = locale!("ES-AR");

    if loc.id.language.as_str() == "es" {
        println!("Â¡Hola amigo!");
    }

    println!("You are using: {}", loc);
}
```

In this case, the parsing is performed at compilation time, so we don't need to handle an error case. Try passing an malformed identifier, like "foo-bar" and call `cargo check`.

*Notice:* `locale!` does not support variants or extension tags (e.g. `u-nu-latn`), as storing these requires allocation. If you have such a tag you need to use runtime parsing.

Next, let's add some more complex functionality.

# 5. Basic Data Management

While the locale API is purely algorithmic, many internationalization APIs require more complex data to work. The most common data set used in Unicode Internationalization is called `CLDR` - `Common Locale Data Repository`.

Data management is a complex and non-trivial area which often requires customizations for particular environments and integrations into projects ecosystem.

The way `ICU4X` plugs into that dataset is one of its novelties, aiming at making the data management more flexible and enabling better integration in asynchronous environments.

As a result, compared to most internationalization solutions, working with data in `ICU4X` is a bit more explicit. `ICU4X` provides a trait called `DataProvider` (as well as `BufferProvider` and `AnyProvider`) and a number of concrete APIs that implement these traits for different scenarios.
Users are also free to design their own providers that best fit into their ecosystem requirements.

`BufferProvider` and `AnyProvider` abstract over different ways the data may be loaded: `BufferProvider` abstracts over data providers that deserialize data, whereas `AnyProvider` abstracts over data providers that can provide concrete Rust objects, like data providers that use [`databake`](https://docs.rs/databake).

In this tutorial we are going to use ICU4X's test data provider and then move on to a synchronous file-system data provider which uses ICU4X format JSON resource files.

## Test data

ICU4X's repository comes with pre-generated test data that covers all of its keys for a select set of locales. For production use it is recommended one use the steps in [Generating Data](#generating-data) to generate custom data, but for the purposes of learning how to use ICU4X, it is sufficient to use the data providers exported by `icu_testdata`. `icu_testdata::any()` will produce an `AnyProvider`, and `icu_testdata::buffer()` will produce a `BufferProvider`. The `any()` provider requires fewer features be enabled so we're using that.

# 6. Using an ICU4X component

We're going to write an app that uses the `icu::datetime` component to format a date and time in a Japanese locale.

First, we need to register our choice of the provider in `./Cargo.toml`, which can be done by running:

```sh
$ cargo add icu_testdata
```

which should generate:

```
[dependencies]
icu = "1.0"
icu_testdata = "1.0"
```

We can then use it in our code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let _provider = icu_testdata::any();
}
```

While this app doesn't do anything on its own yet, we now have a loaded data provider, and can use it to format a date:

```rust
use icu::locid::locale;
use icu::calendar::DateTime;
use icu::datetime::{DateTimeFormatter, options::length};

fn main() {
    let options = length::Bag::from_date_time_style(length::Date::Long, length::Time::Medium);

    let dtf = DateTimeFormatter::try_new_with_any_provider(&icu_testdata::any(), &locale!("ja").into(), options.into())
        .expect("Failed to initialize DateTimeFormatter");


    let date = DateTime::try_new_gregorian_datetime(2020, 10, 14, 13, 21, 28)
        .expect("Failed to create a datetime.");
    // DateTimeFormatter works with data from any calendar, we need to cast to DateTime<AnyCalendar>
    // For smaller codesize you can use TypedDateTimeFormatter<Gregorian> with the DateTime<Gregorian>
    // that we have constructed
    let date = date.to_any();

    let formatted_date = dtf.format(&date).expect("Formatting should succeed");

    println!("ðŸ“…: {}", formatted_date);
}
```

If all went well, running the app with `cargo run` should display:

```
ðŸ“…: 2020å¹´10æœˆ14æ—¥ 13:21:00
```

Here's an internationalized date!

*Notice:* By default, `cargo run` builds and runs a `debug` mode of the binary. If you want to evaluate performance, memory or size of this example, use `cargo run --release`.

# 7. Advanced Data Management

## Using data from the filesystem

If you have ICU4X data on the file system in a JSON format, it can be loaded via `FsDataProvider`, which needs the `icu_provider_fs` crate.

This provider performs deserialization so is a `BufferProvider`. This means that the feature `"serde"` needs to be enabled on `icu` (or the specific `icu_foo` component crate), and `"deserialize_json"` needs to be enabled on `icu_provider`. There are also `"deserialize_postcard_1"` and `"deserialize_bincode_1"` features available.

The whole thing can be done by running:


```sh
$ cargo add icu --features serde
$ cargo add icu_provider_fs
$ cargo add icu_provider --features deserialize_json
```

You may also run `cargo remove icu_testdata` as we don't need it anymore.

This should generate:

```toml
[dependencies]
icu = { version = "1.0", features = ["serde"] }
icu_provider_fs = { version = "1.0.0" }
icu_provider = { version = "1.0.0" , features = ["deserialize_json"] }
```

We can then use it like so

```rs
use icu_provider_fs::FsDataProvider;

fn main() {
    let _provider = FsDataProvider::try_new("/path/to/data")
       .expect("Failed to initialize Data Provider.");
}
```

You will also need to use the `with_buffer_provider` constructors, e.g. `DateTimeFormatter::try_new_with_buffer_provider()`.

You will need to update `/path/to/data` to a local copy of generated data.

You can get a copy by checking out the ICU4X repository; which has test data checked in at `provider/testdata/data/` (use the `json` subfolder for this specific tutorial section). However it is recommended one generate data on their own as described in the [next section](#generating-data). Under the hood, `icu_testdata` is simply loading this data.

Production users are also recommended to use `BlobDataProvider` from `icu_provider_blob`, which allows a binary blob of (usually `postcard` format) data to be loaded from memory. This data provider provides the flexibility of controlling where the data is stored; allowing for data to even be loaded lazily over the network.

Here is a full example:

```rust
use icu::locid::locale;
use icu::calendar::DateTime;
use icu::datetime::{DateTimeFormatter, options::length};
use icu_provider_fs::FsDataProvider;

fn main() {
    let provider = FsDataProvider::try_new("/path/to/data")
       .expect("Failed to initialize Data Provider.");

    let options = length::Bag::from_date_time_style(length::Date::Long, length::Time::Medium);

    let dtf = DateTimeFormatter::try_new_with_buffer_provider(&provider, &locale!("ja").into(), options.into())
        .expect("Failed to initialize DateTimeFormatter");


    let date = DateTime::try_new_gregorian_datetime(2020, 10, 14, 13, 21, 28)
        .expect("Failed to create a datetime.");
    let date = date.to_any();


    let formatted_date = dtf.format(&date).expect("Formatting should succeed");

    println!("ðŸ“…: {}", formatted_date);
}
```


## Generating data

For production usage, it is better to generate your own data that is filtered to suit your needs.

We're going to use [JSON CLDR](https://github.com/unicode-cldr/cldr-json) as our source data. JSON CLDR is an export of [CLDR data](http://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads) into JSON maintained by Unicode.

We are also going to use Unicode property data shipped as a zip file in the ICU4C release.

The `datagen` component has a binary application which will fetch the CLDR data and generate ICU4X data out of it.

```
git clone https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x
cd icu4x
git checkout icu@1.0.0
cargo run --bin icu4x-datagen --features bin -- \
    --cldr-tag latest \
    --icuexport-tag latest \
    --out ~/projects/icu_tutorial/icu4x-data \
    --all-keys --all-locales
```

The last command is a bit dense, so let's dissect it.

* First, we call `cargo run` which runs a binary in the crate
* We tell it that the binary is named `icu4x-datagen`
* We use `--features bin` to be able to build datagen as a binary (it can also be used as a library)
* Then we use `--` to separate arguments to `cargo` from arguments to our app
* Then we pass `--cldr-tag` which informs the program which CLDR version to use
* Then we pass `--icuexport-tag` which informs the program which ICU-exported data version to use
* Then we pass `--out` directory which is where we want the generated ICU4X data to be stored
* Finally, we set `--all-keys --all-locales` which specify that we want to export all keys available, for all locales.

After that step, it should be possible to navigate to `data`, which will contain a `manifest.json` file and a tree of JSON files.


*Notice:* In this tutorial we export data as compact `JSON` which provides decent performance and readable data files. There are other formats and options for formatting of the data available. Please consult `cargo run --bin icu4x-datagen -- --help` for details.
*Notice:* In particular, in production, the `postcard` format (`--format=blob --syntax=postcard`) will yield better performance results.
*Notice:* For offline or unconventional use, the user can also pass `--cldr-root` to a local clone of the CLDR repository instead of `--cldr-tag`.
*Notice:* `--all-keys --all-locales` is a lot of data, in many cases you probably only want the keys for a particular component, for a set of locales you plan to support in the application. Datagen has alternate flags like `--keys` or `--key-file` for this level of control.
*Notice:* This command builds in debug mode since it builds faster; but if you plan on running `icu4x-datagen` a lot (for example, if you wish to create multiple per-key postcard blobs to selectively load), we highly recommend using `--release`.

# 6. Summary

This concludes this introduction tutorial.

With the help of `DateTimeFormat`, `Locale` and `DataProvider` we formatted a date to Japanese, but that's just a start.

The scope of internationalization domain is broad and there are many components with non-trivial interactions between them.

As the feature set of `ICU4X` grows, more and more user interface concepts will become available for internationalization, and more features for fine tuning how the operations are performed will become available.
