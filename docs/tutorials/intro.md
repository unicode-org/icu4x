# Introduction to ICU4X for Rust

`ICU4X` is an implementation of [Internationalization Components of Unicode](http://site.icu-project.org/) (ICU) intended to be modular, performant and flexible.

The library provides a layer of APIs for all software to enable internationalization capabilities.

To use `ICU4X` in the Rust ecosystem one can either add dependencies on selected components, or add a dependency on the meta-crate `icu` which brings a reasonable selection of components in the most user-friendly configuration of features.

In this tutorial we are going to build up to writing an app that uses the `icu::datetime` component to format a date and time in a Japanese locale, covering various topics in the process.

# 1. Requirements

For this tutorial we assume the user has basic Rust knowledge. If acquiring it is necessary, the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) provides an excellent introduction.
We also assume that the user is familiar with a terminal and have `git`, `rust` and `cargo` installed.

To verify that, open a terminal and check that the results are similar to:

```
user@host:~/projects/icu_tutorial$ git --version
git version 2.31.1
user@host:~/projects/icu_tutorial$ cargo --version
cargo 1.51.0 (43b129a20 2021-03-16)
```

In this tutorial we are going to use a directory relative to the user's home directory `~/projects/icu_tutorial/`. The `~` in the path indicates the relative location of the user home directory.

# 2. Creating MyApp

To initialize a binary application, navigate to the root directory of our project and initialize a new binary app called `myapp`:

```
cd ~/projects/icu_tutorial
cargo new --bin myapp
```

The result is a new directory `~/projects/icu_tutorial/myapp` with a file `./src/main.rs` which is the main file for our application.

# 3. Adding ICU4X as a dependency

`ICU4X`'s main meta package is called `icu`, so to start using it, all one has to do it edit their `~/projects/icu_tutorial/myapp/Cargo.toml`. The easiest way to do this is to run:

```sh
$ cargo add icu
```

which should generate:

```toml
[dependencies]
icu = "1.0"
```

After saving the changes, commands like `cargo check` will download the `icu` Rust package and use it for the build.

# 4. Locales

`ICU4X` comes with a variety of components allowing to manage various facets of software internationalization.

Most of those features depend on the selection of a `Locale` which is a particular combination of language, script, region with optional variants. An examples of such locales are `en-US` (American English), `sr-Cyrl` (Serbian with Cyrillic script) or `es-AR` (Argentinian Spanish).

In `ICU4X` `Locale` is a part of the `locid` component. If the user needs just this one feature, they can use `icu_locid` crate as a dependency, but since here we already added a dependency on `icu`, we can refer to it via `icu::locid`.

Let's update our application to use it.

Open `~/projects/icu_tutorial/myapp/src/main.rs` and edit it to:

```rust
use icu::locid::Locale;

fn main() {
    let loc: Locale = "ES-AR".parse()
        .expect("Failed to parse locale.");

    if loc.id.language.as_str() == "es" {
        println!("¡Hola amigo!");
    }

    println!("You are using: {}", loc);
}
```
*Notice:* Here, `ICU4X` canonicalized the locales's syntax which uses lowercase letters for the language portion.

After saving it, call `cargo run` in `~/projects/icu_tutorial/myapp` and it should display:

```
¡Hola amigo!
You are using: es-AR
```

Congratulations! `ICU4X` has been used to semantically operate on a locale!

## Convenience macro

The scenario of working with statically declared Locales is common.

It's a bit unergonomic to have to parse them at runtime and handle a parser error in such case.

For that purpose, ICU4X provides a macro one can use to parse it at compilation time:

```rust
use icu::locid::locale;

fn main() {
    let loc = locale!("ES-AR");

    if loc.id.language.as_str() == "es" {
        println!("¡Hola amigo!");
    }

    println!("You are using: {}", loc);
}
```

In this case, the parsing is performed at compilation time, so we don't need to handle an error case. Try passing an malformed identifier, like "foo-bar" and try to call `cargo check`.

*Notice:* `locale!` does not support variants or extension tags, as storing these requires allocation. If you have such a tag you need to use runtime parsing.

Next, let's add some more complex functionality.

# 5. Basic Data Management

While the locale API is purely algorithmic, many internationalization APIs require more complex data to work. The most common data set used in Unicode Internationalization is called `CLDR` - `Common Locale Data Repository`.

Data management is a complex and non-trivial area which often requires customizations for particular environments and integrations into projects ecosystem.

The way `ICU4X` plugs into that dataset is one of its novelties, aiming at making the data management more flexible and enabling better integration in asynchronous environments.

In result, compared to most internationalization solutions, working with data in `ICU4X` is a bit more explicit. `ICU4X` provides a trait called `DataProvider` (as well as `BufferProvider` and `AnyProvider`) and a number of concrete APIs that implement these traits for different scenarios.
Users are also free to design their own providers that best fit into their ecosystem requirements.

`BufferProvider` and `AnyProvider` abstract over different ways the data may be loaded: `BufferProvider` abstracts over data providers that deserialize data, whereas `AnyProvider` abstracts over data providers that can provide concrete Rust objects, like data providers that use [`databake`](https://docs.rs/databake).

In this tutorial we are going to use ICU4X's "test" data provider and then move on to a synchronous file-system data provider which uses ICU4X format JSON resource files.

## Test data

ICU4X's repository comes with pre-generated test data that covers all of its keys for a select set of locales. For production use it is recommended one use the steps in [Generating Data](#generating-data) to generate custom data, but for the purposes of trying stuff out, it is sufficient to use the data providers exported by `icu_testdata`. `icu_testdata::any()` will produce an `AnyProvider`, and `icu_testdata::buffer()` will produce a `BufferProvider`.

# 6. Using an ICU4X component

We're going to try writing an app that uses the `icu::datetime` component to format a date and time in a Japanese locale.

First, we need to register our choice of the provider in `~/projects/icu_tutorial/myapp/Cargo.toml`, which can be done by running:

```sh
$ cargo add icu_testdata
```

which should generate:

```
[dependencies]
icu = "1.0"
icu_testdata = "1.0"
```

We can then use it in our code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let _provider = icu_testdata::any();
}
```

While this app doesn't do anything on its own yet, we now have a loaded data provider, and can use it to format a date:

```rust
use icu::locid::locale;
use icu::calendar::DateTime;
use icu::datetime::{DateTimeFormatter, options::length};

fn main() {
    let date = DateTime::try_new_gregorian_datetime(2020, 10, 14, 13, 21, 28)
        .expect("Failed to create a datetime.");

    let options = length::Bag::from_date_time_style(length::Date::Long, length::Time::Medium);

    // DateTimeFormatter works with data from any calendar, we need to cast to DateTime<AnyCalendar>
    // For smaller codesize you can use TypedDateTimeFormatter<Gregorian> with the DateTime<Gregorian>
    // that we have constructed
    let date = date.to_any();

    let dtf = DateTimeFormatter::try_new_with_any_provider(&icu_testdata::any(), &locale!("ja").into(), options.into())
        .expect("Failed to initialize DateTimeFormatter");

    let formatted_date = dtf.format(&date).expect("Formatting should succeed");

    println!("📅: {}", formatted_date);
}
```

If all went well, running the app with `cargo run` should display:

```
📅: 2020年10月14日 13:21:00
```

Here's an internationalized date!

*Notice:* By default, `cargo run` builds and runs a `debug` mode of the binary. If you want to evaluate performance, memory or size of this example, use `cargo run --release`. Our example is also using resources in the `json`  format. It is recommended you generate the data in the `postcard` format (and use it with `BlobDataProvider`) for better performance.

# 7. Advanced Data Management

## Using data from the filesystem

If you have ICU4X data on the file system in a JSON format, it can be loaded via `FsDataProvider`, which needs the `icu_provider_fs` crate.

This provider performs deserialization so is a `BufferProvider`. This means that the feature `"serde"` needs to be enabled on `icu` (or the specific `icu_foo` component crate), and `"deserialize_json"` needs to be enabled on `icu_provider`. There are also `"deserialize_postcard_1"` and `"deserialize_bincode_1"` features available.

The whole thing can be done by running:


```sh
$ cargo add icu --features serde
$ cargo add icu_provider_fs
$ cargo add icu_provider --features deserialize_json
```

You may also run `cargo remove icu_testdata` as we don't need it anymore.

This should generate:

```toml
[dependencies]
icu = { version = "1.0", features = ["serde"] }
icu_provider_fs = { version = "1.0.0" }
icu_provider = { version = "1.0.0" , features = ["deserialize_json"] }
```

We can then use it like so:

```rs
use icu_provider_fs::FsDataProvider;

fn main() {
    let _provider = FsDataProvider::try_new("/path/to/data")
       .expect("Failed to initialize Data Provider.");
}
```

You will also need to use the `with_buffer_provider` constructors, e.g. `DateTimeFormatter::try_new_with_buffer_provider()`.

The ICU4X repository has test data checked in tree in `provider/testdata/data`, however it is recommended one generate data on their own as described in the [next section](#generating-data). Under the hood, `icu_testdata` is simply loading this data.

Production users are recommended to use `BlobDataProvider` from `icu_provider_blob`, which allows a binary blob of (usually `postcard` format) data to be loaded from memory. This data provider provides the flexibility of controlling where the data is stored; allowing for data to even be loaded lazily over the network.

Here is a full example:

```rust
use icu::locid::locale;
use icu::calendar::DateTime;
use icu::datetime::{DateTimeFormatter, options::length};
use icu_provider_fs::FsDataProvider;

fn main() {
    let date = DateTime::try_new_gregorian_datetime(2020, 10, 14, 13, 21, 28)
        .expect("Failed to create a datetime.");

    let options = length::Bag::from_date_time_style(length::Date::Long, length::Time::Medium);

    let provider = FsDataProvider::try_new("/path/to/data")
       .expect("Failed to initialize Data Provider.");

    let date = date.to_any();

    let dtf = DateTimeFormatter::try_new_with_buffer_provider(&provider, &locale!("ja").into(), options.into())
        .expect("Failed to initialize DateTimeFormatter");

    let formatted_date = dtf.format(&date).expect("Formatting should succeed");

    println!("📅: {}", formatted_date);
}
```


## Generating data

For production usage, it is better to generate your own data that is filtered to suit your needs.

We're going to use [JSON CLDR](https://github.com/unicode-cldr/cldr-json) as our source data. JSON CLDR is an export of [CLDR data](http://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads) into JSON maintained by Unicode.

We are also going to use Unicode property data shipped as a zip file in the ICU4C release.

The `datagen` component has a binary application which will fetch the CLDR data and generate ICU4X data out of it.

```
git clone https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x
cd icu4x
git checkout icu@1.0.0
cargo run --bin icu4x-datagen --features bin -- \
    --cldr-tag latest \
    --icuexport-tag latest \
    --out ~/projects/icu_tutorial/icu4x-data \
    --all-keys --all-locales
```

The last command is a bit dense, so let's dissect it.

* First, we call `cargo run` which runs a binary in the crate
* We tell it that the binary is named `icu4x-datagen`
* We use `--features bin` to be able to build datagen as a binary (it can also be used as a library)
* Then we use `--` to separate arguments to `cargo` from arguments to our app
* Then we pass `--cldr-tag` which informs the program which CLDR version to use
* Then we pass `--icuexport-tag` which informs the program which ICU-exported data version to use
* Then we pass `--out` directory which is where we want the generated ICU4X data to be stored
* Finally, we set `--all-keys --all-locales` which specify that we want to export all keys available, for locales.

After that step, it should be possible to navigate to `~/projects/icu_tutorial/icu4x-data` and there should be a `manifest.json` file, and directories with data.


*Notice:* In this tutorial we export data as compact `JSON` which provides decent performance and readable data files. There are other formats and options for formatting of the data available. Please consult `cargo run --bin icu4x-datagen -- --help` for details.
*Notice:* In particular, in production, the `postcard` format (`--format=blob --syntax=postcard`) will yield better performance results.
*Notice:* For offline or unconventional use, the user can also pass `--cldr-root` to a local clone of the CLDR repository instead of `--cldr-tag`.
*Notice:* `--all-keys --all-locales` is a lot of data, in many cases you probably only want the keys for a particular component, for a set of locales you plan to support in the application. Datagen has alternate flags like `--keys` or `--key-file` for this level of control.
*Notice:* This command builds in debug mode since it's faster; but if you plan on running `icu4x-datagen` a lot (for example, if you wish to create multiple per-key postcard blobs to selectively load), we highly recommend using `--release`.

# 6. Summary

This concludes this introduction tutorial.

With the help of `DateTimeFormat`, `Locale` and `DataProvider` we formatted a date to Japanese, but that's just a start.

The scope of internationalization domain is broad and there are many components with non-trivial interactions between them.

As the feature set of `ICU4X` grows, more and more user interface concepts will become available for internationalization, and more features for fine tuning how the operations are performed will become available.
