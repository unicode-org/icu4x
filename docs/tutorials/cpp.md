# Using ICU4X from C++

ICU4X's core functionality is completely available from C++, with headers generated by [Diplomat].

Generated headers can be found under [`ffi/capi/cpp/include`], with Sphinx docs at [`ffi/capi/cpp/docs`]. The port is header-only; no additional C++ translation units need to be compiled to use ICU4X from C++.

Typically C++ users can build ICU4X by building the `icu_capi_staticlib` crate ([crates.io][staticlib-crates], [source][staticlib-source]), and linking the resultant static library to their C++ application. This crate builds on the `icu_capi` crate: a `no_std` crate containing all of the relevant [Diplomat]-generated `extern "C"` declarations.

Using ICU4X in C++ is best demonstrated via the [examples] present in the codebase. For example, [here's an example showing off decimal formatting in ICU4X][decimal-example-code], built with [this Makefile][decimal-example-makefile].

_We are still working on improving the user experience of using ICU4X from other languages. As such, this tutorial may be a bit sparse, but we are happy to answer questions on our [discussions forum] and help you out_

## Building and linking ICU4X

- `cargo build` only supports local crates, so you have to download the published code from crates.io
    - You can use `cargo clone icu_capi_staticlib@1.0.0` to do this (`cargo install cargo-clone` if the command is not installed)
- Inside the crate you can use `cargo build` to build the library
    - Be sure to pass `--release` to get an optimized build
    - Specify Cargo features with `--features ...`:
        - `compiled_data` \[default\] to include data (`ICU4XDataProvider::create_compiled()`)
        - `simple_logger` \[default\] enable basic stdout logging of error metadata. Further loggers can be added on request.
        - `buffer_provider` for working with blob data providers (`ICU4XDataProvider::create_from_byte_slice()`)
        - `provider_fs` for loading data from the file system (`ICU4XDataProvider::create_fs()`). This also requires enabling a syntax on the `icu_provider` crate.
    - Set `CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_LTO=true` to enable link-time optimization
    - Set `CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_OPT_LEVEL="s"` to optimize for size
    - See [cargo profiles](cargo-profiles) for more options
 - Copy the header files from the `icu_capi` crate
    - If you're using the default crate registry, they will be in `~/.cargo/registry/src/*/icu_capi-1.0.0/cpp/include`
    - If you cannot find the crate, download it from crates.io
    - Make sure to use the same version as above
        - While we selected a version for `icu_capi_staticlib` before, and here we're looking at `icu_capi`, those versions will always be in sync. You can sanity check this by running `cargo pkgid -p icu_capi`.
 - Compile with `g++ -std=c++17 icu/target/release/libicu_capi_staticlib.a -ldl -lpthread -lm`. C++ versions beyond C++17 are supported, as are other C++ compilers.

## Using ICU4X from C++
Here's an annotated, shorter version of the fixed decimal example, that can be built using the steps above:

 ```cpp
#include "path/to/include/ICU4XFixedDecimalFormatter.hpp"
#include "path/to/include/ICU4XDataStruct.hpp"
#include "path/to/include/ICU4XLogger.hpp"

#include <iostream>
#include <array>

int main() {
    // For basic logging
    ICU4XLogger::init_simple_logger();

    // Create a locale object representing Bangla
    ICU4XLocale locale = ICU4XLocale::create_from_string("bn").ok().value();

    // Use compiled data
    ICU4XDataProvider dp = ICU4XDataProvider::create_compiled();

    // Create a formatter object with the appropriate settings
    ICU4XFixedDecimalFormatter fdf = ICU4XFixedDecimalFormatter::create_with_grouping_strategy(
        dp, locale, ICU4XFixedDecimalGroupingStrategy::Auto).ok().value();

    // Create a decimal representing the number 1,000,007
    ICU4XFixedDecimal decimal = ICU4XFixedDecimal::create_from_u64(1000007);

    // Format it to a string
    std::string out = fdf.format(decimal).ok().value();

    // Report formatted value
    std::cout << "Formatted value is " << out << std::endl;
    if (out != "১০,০০,০০৭") {
        std::cout << "Output does not match expected output" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Embedded platforms (`no_std`)

Users wishing to use ICU4X on a `no_std` platform will need to write their own crate depending on `icu_capi` that fills in an allocator and a panic hook, similar to what we do in our [example](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x/blob/main/ffi/capi/c/examples/fixeddecimal_tiny/icu_capi_staticlib_tiny/src/lib.rs):

```rust,compile_fail
#![no_std]

// Expose icu_capi symbols
extern crate icu_capi;

#[global_allocator]
static ALLOCATOR: dlmalloc::GlobalDlmalloc = dlmalloc::GlobalDlmalloc;

#[panic_handler]
fn panic(_info: &core::panic::PanicInfo) -> ! {
    loop {}
}
```

This can then be compiled with `cargo +nightly -Z build-std=std,panic_abort -Z build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort` for a minimal build.

## Tips

Documentation can be found in the Sphinx docs found [`ffi/capi/cpp/docs`]. These docs mirror the Rust code in the `icu_capi` crate, which can be explored on [docs.rs][rust-docs], though the precise types used may be different.

Fallible methods return `diplomat::result`, a Result type that can most commonly be converted to a `std::optional` over its Ok/Err types by calling `.ok()` or `.err()`. Most methods either use `ICU4XError` (an enum of error codes) as their error type, or `std::monostate`. Further error details can be logged by enabling a logger via `ICU4XLogger`, further loggers may be added on request.

The C++ headers include C headers for the underlying APIs as well, under namespace `capi`, found in the `.h` files. While these can be used directly, we recommend against it unless you are writing C code. These headers are not intended to be ergonomic and primarily exist for the C++ headers to use internally.

Slices are represented using `std::span` if available, otherwise a simple wrapper called `diplomat::span` is used.

These bindings may be customized by running `diplomat-tool` directly (including replacing the types used with alternate types like `mozilla::Span`), please ask on our [discussions forum] for more help on this.
