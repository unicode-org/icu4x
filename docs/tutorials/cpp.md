# Using ICU4X from C++

ICU4X's core functionality is completely available from C++, with headers generated by [Diplomat]. The port is header-only; no additional C++ translation units need to be compiled to use ICU4X from C++.

Typically C++ users can build ICU4X by building the `icu_capi` Rust crate, and linking the resultant static library to their C++ application. This crate contains all of the relevant [Diplomat]-generated `extern "C"` declarations, as well as an idiomatic C++ wrapper using these functions.

Using ICU4X in C++ is best demonstrated via the [examples](cpp). For example, [here's an example showing off decimal formatting in ICU4X](cpp/fixeddecimal.cpp), built with [this Makefile](cpp/Makefile).

_We are still working on improving the user experience of using ICU4X from other languages. As such, this tutorial may be a bit sparse, but we are happy to answer questions on our [discussions forum] and help you out_

## Building ICU4X

After [installing Rust](https://rustup.rs), create a local Rust configuration for ICU4X:

```shell
touch Cargo.toml
```

```toml
[package]
name = "unused"
version = "0.0.0"

[lib]
path = "unused"

[dependencies]
icu_capi = { version = "1.4", default-features = false }
```

Some of the keys are required by the parser, but won't be used by us. 

`icu_capi` supports a list of option features:

- `default` enables a default set of features
- `std` \[default\] set this when building for a target with a Rust standard library, otherwise see below
- `compiled_data` \[default\] to include data (`ICU4XDataProvider::create_compiled()`)
- `simple_logger` \[default\] enable basic stdout logging of error metadata. Further loggers can be added on request.
- `default_components` \[default\] activate all stable ICU4X components. For smaller builds, this can be disabled, and components can be added with features like `icu_list`.
- `buffer_provider` for working with blob data providers (`ICU4XDataProvider::create_from_byte_slice()`)

You can now set features using the `--features icu_capi/<feature>` syntax to build the library:

```shell
cargo rustc --release -p icu_capi --crate-type staticlib --features icu_capi/default,icu_capi/buffer_provider
```

- Be sure to pass `--release` to get an optimized build
- Set `CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_LTO=true` to enable link-time optimization
- Set `CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_OPT_LEVEL="s"` to optimize for size
- See [cargo profiles](cargo-profiles) for more options

You should now have a `target/release/libicu_capi.a`, ready to compile into your C++ binary.

## Using ICU4X from C++
Here's an annotated, shorter version of the fixed decimal example:

 ```cpp
#include "ICU4XFixedDecimalFormatter.hpp"
#include "ICU4XDataStruct.hpp"
#include "ICU4XLogger.hpp"

#include <iostream>
#include <array>

int main() {
    // For basic logging
    ICU4XLogger::init_simple_logger();

    // Create a locale object representing Bangla
    ICU4XLocale locale = ICU4XLocale::create_from_string("bn").ok().value();

    // Use compiled data
    ICU4XDataProvider dp = ICU4XDataProvider::create_compiled();

    // Create a formatter object with the appropriate settings
    ICU4XFixedDecimalFormatter fdf = ICU4XFixedDecimalFormatter::create_with_grouping_strategy(
        dp, locale, ICU4XFixedDecimalGroupingStrategy::Auto).ok().value();

    // Create a decimal representing the number 1,000,007
    ICU4XFixedDecimal decimal = ICU4XFixedDecimal::create_from_u64(1000007);

    // Format it to a string
    std::string out = fdf.format(decimal).ok().value();

    // Report formatted value
    std::cout << "Formatted value is " << out << std::endl;
    if (out != "১০,০০,০০৭") {
        std::cout << "Output does not match expected output" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Compiling with the ICU4X header files

The header files are shipped inside the crate, which Cargo has put somewhere on your system. You can find its location with
```shell
HEADERS=$(cargo metadata --format-version 1 | jq '.packages[] | select(.name == "icu_capi").manifest_path' | xargs dirname)/bindings/cpp
```

Then you can build with
```shell
g++ -Ltarget/release -I"$HEADERS" main.cpp -licu_capi
```

C++ versions beyond C++17 are supported, as are other C++ compilers.

## Embedded platforms (`no_std`)

Users wishing to use ICU4X on a `no_std` platform will need to provide an allocator and a panic hook in order to build a linkable library. The `icu_capi` crate can provide a looping panic handler, and a `malloc`-backed allocator, under the `looping_panic_handler` and `libc_alloc` features, respectively.

```
cargo rustc --release -p icu_capi --crate-type staticlib --features icu_capi/default_components,icu_capi/buffer_provider,icu_capi/looping_panic_handler,icu_capi/libc_alloc
```

## Tips

Documentation can be found [here](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu4x/cppdoc/). These docs mirror the Rust code in the `icu_capi` crate, which can be explored on [docs.rs][rust-docs], though the precise types used may be different.

Fallible methods return `diplomat::result`, a Result type that can most commonly be converted to a `std::optional` over its Ok/Err types by calling `.ok()` or `.err()`. Most methods either use `ICU4XError` (an enum of error codes) as their error type, or `std::monostate`. Further error details can be logged by enabling a logger via `ICU4XLogger`, further loggers may be added on request.

The C++ headers include C headers for the underlying APIs as well, under namespace `capi`, found in the `.h` files. While these can be used directly, we recommend against it unless you are writing C code. These headers are not intended to be ergonomic and primarily exist for the C++ headers to use internally.

Slices are represented using `std::span` if available, otherwise a simple wrapper called `diplomat::span` is used.

These bindings may be customized by running `diplomat-tool` directly (including replacing the types used with alternate types like `mozilla::Span`), please ask on our [discussions forum] for more help on this.
