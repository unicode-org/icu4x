# Using ICU4X from C++

ICU4X's core functionality is completely available from C++, with headers generated by [Diplomat].

Generated headers can be found under [`ffi/diplomat/cpp/include`], with Sphinx docs at [`ffi/diplomat/cpp/docs`]. The port is header-only; no additional C++ translation units need to be compiled to use ICU4X from C++.

Typically C++ users can build ICU4X by building the `icu_capi_staticlib` crate ([crates.io][staticlib-crates], [source][staticlib-source]) with the `cpp_default` feature, and link the resultant static library to their C++ application. This crate builds on the `icu_capi` crate: a `no_std` crate containing all of the relevant [Diplomat]-generated `extern "C"` declarations.

Using ICU4X in C++ is best demonstrated via the [examples] present in the codebase. For example, [here's an example showing off decimal formatting in ICU4X][decimal-example-code], built with [this Makefile][decimal-example-makefile].

_We are still working on improving the user experience of using ICU4X from other languages. As such, this tutorial may be a bit sparse, but we are happy to answer questions on our [discussions forum] and help you out_

## Building and linking ICU4X

As seen in the Makefile, if one wishes to use ICU4X in C++, one should:

 - Fetch `icu_capi_staticlib` from somewhere, either by downloading from crates.io, or cloning the `icu4x` repository at the appropriately tagged version
 - Fetch the headers from [`ffi/diplomat/cpp/include`] in the ICU4X repo.
 - Build `icu_capi_staticlib` with `cargo build -p icu_capi_staticlib --release`. Be sure to pass `--release` to get an optimized build! Further options include:
    - Cargo features (passed in via `--features foo,bar,..`)
        - `provider_test` to include testing data via `ICU4XDataProvider::create_test()` (not recommended for production builds). It needs `buffer_provider` or `any_provider` to be enabled.
        - `provider_fs`  for loading data from files with `ICU4XDataProvider::create_fs()`
        - `icu_provider/deserialize_json`  for JSON support in `ICU4XDataProvider::create_fs()`
        - `buffer_provider` for working with blob data providers (`ICU4XDataProvider::create_from_byte_slice()`)
        - `logging` and `simple_logger` enable basic stdout logging of error metadata. Further loggers can be added on request.
        - `cpp_default` turns on a bunch of these and is useful for exploration, but should not be used in production as it enables `provider_test`
    - Build options:       
        - `--profile=release-opt-size` to optimize for size
        - Using `cargo panic-abort-build` and potentially `--features=x86tiny` (see below)
 - Copy out the static library from `target/{debug, release}/libicu_capi_staticlib.a`
 - Build their code with `g++ -std=c++17 libicu_capi_staticlib_test.a -ldl -lpthread -lm`. C++ versions beyond C++17 are supported, as are other C++ compilers.

## Using ICU4X from C++
Here's an annotated, shorter version of the fixed decimal example, that can be built using the steps above, using `--features cpp_default`:

 ```cpp
#include "path/to/include/ICU4XFixedDecimalFormatter.hpp"
#include "path/to/include/ICU4XDataStruct.hpp"
#include "path/to/include/ICU4XLogger.hpp"

#include <iostream>
#include <array>

int main() {
    // For basic logging
    ICU4XLogger::init_simple_logger();

    // Create a locale object representing Bangla
    ICU4XLocale locale = ICU4XLocale::create_from_string("bn").ok().value();

    // Use a testing data provider
    // Production code probably should use create_fs() or create_from_byte_slice()
    // with data generated by icu4x-datagen
    ICU4XDataProvider dp = ICU4XDataProvider::create_test();

    // Create a formatter object with the appropriate settings
    ICU4XFixedDecimalFormatter fdf = ICU4XFixedDecimalFormatter::create_with_grouping_strategy(
        dp, locale, ICU4XFixedDecimalGroupingStrategy::Auto).ok().value();

    // Create a decimal representing the number 1,000,007
    ICU4XFixedDecimal decimal = ICU4XFixedDecimal::create_from_u64(1000007);

    // Format it to a string
    std::string out = fdf.format(decimal).ok().value();

    // Report formatted value
    std::cout << "Formatted value is " << out << std::endl;
    if (out != "১০,০০,০০৭") {
        std::cout << "Output does not match expected output" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## no_std and embedded platforms

Users wishing to use ICU4X on a `no_std` platform will need to write their own crate depending on `icu_capi` that fills in an allocator and panic hooks, similar to what we do in our [freertos port]. ICU4X is happy to accept such ports upstream.

The `icu_capi_staticlib` crate additionally supports an `x86tiny` for highly size-optimized builds, to be run with `cargo panic-abort-build` (shorthand for `build` with `-Z build-std=std,panic_abort -Z build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort`). This requires a nighly compiler; it has been tested to work on `nightly-2022-04-05`.

## Tips

Documentation can be found in the Sphinx docs found [`ffi/diplomat/cpp/docs`]. These docs mirror the Rust code in the `icu_capi` crate, which can be explored on [docs.rs][rust-docs], though the precise types used may be different.

Fallible methods return `diplomat::result`, a Result type that can most commonly be converted to a `std::optional` over its Ok/Err types by calling `.ok()` or `.err()`. Most methods either use `ICU4XError` (an enum of error codes) as their error type, or `std::monostate`. Further error details can be logged by enabling a logger via `ICU4XLogger`, further loggers may be added on request.

The C++ headers include C headers for the underlying APIs as well, under namespace `capi`, found in the `.h` files. While these can be used directly, we recommend against it unless you are writing C code. These headers are not intended to be ergonomic and primarily exist for the C++ headers to use internally.

Slices are represented using `std::span` if available, otherwise a simple wrapper called `diplomat::span` is used.

These bindings may be customized by running `diplomat-tool` directly (including replacing the types used with alternate types like `mozilla::Span`), please ask on our [discussions forum] for more help on this.
