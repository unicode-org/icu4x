# Using ICU4X from JavaScript and TypeScript

ICU4X's core functionality is completely available from JS and TypeScript via WebAssembly, with bindings generated by [Diplomat].

The NPM package can be found under [`ffi/capi/js/package`], with docs [here](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu4x/docs/ffi/ts/).

_We are still working on improving the user experience of using ICU4X from other languages. As such, this tutorial may be a bit sparse, but we are happy to answer questions on our [discussions forum] and help you out_

# Using the package

Similar to C++, the JS APIs mirror the Rust code in the `icu_capi` crate, which can be explored on [docs.rs][rust-docs], though the precise types used may be different.

See [`ffi/capi/js/examples/wasm-demo`] for an NPM package that uses the ICU4X package. You can run it using `npm run start`.

We hope to fill in these docs over time with more examples.
