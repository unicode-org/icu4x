# Using ICU4X from JavaScript and TypeScript

ICU4X's core functionality is completely available from JS and TypeScript via WebAssembly, with bindings generated by [Diplomat].


A generated package can be found under [`ffi/diplomat/wasm/icu4x`], with Sphinx docs at [`ffi/diplomat/wasm/icu4x/docs`]. You can also run `tsdoc` on the package to get TypeScript docs.

_We are still working on improving the user experience of using ICU4X from other languages. As such, this tutorial may be a bit sparse, but we are happy to answer questions on our [discussions forum] and help you out_

# Building the package

We plan to release ICU4X on NPM soon. In the meantime, you can build the package yourself.

The package needs to contain ICU4X WASM sources, the best way to do this is to check out ICU4X at the appropriate versioned tag and running `cargo make wasm-copy-to-diplomat`.

# Using the built package

We hope to fill in these docs over time with more examples. In the meantime, an ICU4X web demo can be built with `cargo make diplomat-build-webpack-demo` and found in [`ffi/diplomat/wasm/icu4x/wasm-demo`], you can explore that code for ideas on how ICU4X is used.

Similar to C++, the JS APIs mirror the Rust code in the `icu_capi` crate, which can be explored on [docs.rs][rust-docs], though the precise types used may be different.
