# icu_segmenter [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/icu_segmenter)](https://crates.io/crates/icu_segmenter)

ðŸš§ \[Experimental\] Segment strings by lines, graphemes, word, and sentences.

This module is published as its own crate ([`icu_segmenter`](https://docs.rs/icu_segmenter/latest/icu_segmenter/))
and as part of the [`icu`](https://docs.rs/icu/latest/icu/) crate. See the latter for more details on the ICU4X project.

This module contains segmenter implementation for the following rules.

- Line breaker that is compatible with [Unicode Standard Annex #14][UAX14] and CSS properties.
- Grapheme cluster breaker, word breaker, and sentence breaker that are compatible with
  [Unicode Standard Annex #29][UAX29].

ðŸš§ This code is experimental; it may change at any time, in breaking or non-breaking ways,
including in SemVer minor releases. It can be enabled with the "experimental" Cargo feature

## Examples

### Line Break

Segment a string with default options:

```rust
use icu::segmenter::LineSegmenter;

let segmenter = LineSegmenter::try_new_auto_unstable(&icu_testdata::unstable())
    .expect("Data exists");

let breakpoints: Vec<usize> =
    segmenter.segment_str("Hello World").collect();
assert_eq!(&breakpoints, &[6, 11]);
```

See [`LineSegmenter`] for more examples.

### Grapheme Cluster Break

See [`GraphemeClusterSegmenter`] for examples.

### Word Break

Segment a string:

```rust
use icu::segmenter::WordSegmenter;

let segmenter = WordSegmenter::try_new_auto_unstable(&icu_testdata::unstable())
    .expect("Data exists");

let breakpoints: Vec<usize> =
    segmenter.segment_str("Hello World").collect();
assert_eq!(&breakpoints, &[0, 5, 6, 11]);
```

See [`WordSegmenter`] for more examples.

### Sentence Break

See [`SentenceSegmenter`] for examples.
