<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

This crate contains the `extern "C"` FFI for ICU4X, as well as the [Diplomat](https://github.com/rust-diplomat/diplomat)-generated
C, C++, Dart, JavaScript, and TypeScript bindings.
<p style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;'> 🔗 See the <a target='_blank' href='https://icu4x.unicode.org/
'>ICU4X website</a> for FFI docs and examples</p>

This crate is `no_std`-compatible, but requires an allocator. If you wish to use it in `no_std` mode, you can either
enable the `looping_panic_handler` and `libc_alloc` Cargo features, or write a wrapper crate that defines an
allocator/panic handler.

<div class="stab unstable">
🚧 While the types in this crate are public, APIs from this crate are <em>not intended to be used from Rust</em> and as
such this crate may unpredictably change its Rust API across compatible semver versions.

The <code>extern "C"</code> APIs exposed by this crate, while not directly documented, are stable within the same major
semver version, as are the bindings in the <code>bindings</code> folder.
