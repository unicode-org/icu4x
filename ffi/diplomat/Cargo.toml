# Unfortunately, --crate-type cannot be set per-target
# (https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4881)
# and emscripten has link errors when compiling icu_capi due to
# symbols like log_js being undefined. There is no way to ask Cargo
# to only build a particular crate type for an invocation
#
# As a workaround, we define an example crate that just reexports icu_capi,
# but is built as a cdylib. Due to how Cargo invocations work around examples,
# `--features` is still passed down to `icu_capi`, but the end result is an
# `icu_capi_cdylib.wasm`/`icu_capi_cdylib.so`/etc file that is for all intents
# and purposes identical to the file one would get from adding "cdylib" to
# `crate-type` above.
