//! This crate contains the source of truth for the [Diplomat](https://github.com/rust-diplomat/diplomat)-generated
//! FFI bindings. This generates the C, C++, JavaScript, and TypeScript bindings. This crate also contains the `extern "C"`
//! FFI for ICU4X.
//!
//! While the types in this crate are public, APIs from this crate are *not intended to be used from Rust*
//! and as such this crate may unpredictably change its Rust API across compatible semver versions. The `extern "C"` APIs exposed
//! by this crate, while not directly documented, are stable within the same major semver version, as are the bindings exposed under
//! the `cpp/` and `js/` folders.
//!
//! This crate may still be explored for documentation on docs.rs, and there are generated language-specific docs available as well.
//! C++ has sphinx docs in `cpp/docs/`, and the header files also contain documentation comments. The JS version has sphinx docs under
//! `js/docs`, and the TypeScript sources in `js/include` are compatible with `tsdoc`.
//!
//! This crate is `no_std` and will not typically build as a staticlib on its own. If you wish to link to it you should prefer
//! using `icu_capi_staticlib`, or for more esoteric platforms you may write a shim crate depending on this crate that hooks in
//! an allocator and panic hook.
//!
//! More information on using ICU4X from C++ can be found in [our tutorial].
