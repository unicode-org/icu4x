# It's fine for APIs to show up here temporarily, but this file should be clean during release.
# If you have added an API that you feel needs to be an exception, add it to IGNORED_PATHS in tools/ffi_coverage/src/main.rs
# and tag @Manishearth, @robertbastian, or @sffc for help on where it should go.
