# Using from JavaScript and TypeScript

ICU4X's core functionality is completely available from JS and TypeScript via WebAssembly, with bindings generated by [Diplomat].

The NPM package's docs can be found [here](https://icu4x.unicode.org/2_0/tsdoc/).

_We are still working on improving the user experience of using ICU4X from other languages. As such, this tutorial may be a bit sparse, but we are happy to answer questions on our [discussions forum] and help you out_
