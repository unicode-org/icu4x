# ICU4X for JavaScript and TypeScript

ICU4X provides components enabling wide range of software internationalization.
It draws deeply from the experience of [`ICU4C`](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/released/icu4c/), [`ICU4J`](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/released/icu4j/) and [`ECMA-402`](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/) and relies on data from the [`CLDR`](http://cldr.unicode.org/) project.

ICU4X's core functionality is completely available from JS and TypeScript via WebAssembly, with bindings generated by [Diplomat].

The NPM package's docs can be found [here](https://icu4x.unicode.org/2_0/tsdoc/).

_We are still working on improving the user experience of using ICU4X from other languages. As such, this tutorial may be a bit sparse, but we are happy to answer questions on our [discussions forum] and help you out_

## Using ICU4X

ICU4X can be used like any other NPM package:

```shell
npm add icu
touch index.mjs
```

`index.mjs`:
```js
import { DateFormatter, DateTimeLength, IsoDate, Locale } from 'icu';

let locale = Locale.fromString('de-CH');

let date = new IsoDate(2025, 1, 2);

let formatter = DateFormatter.createYmde(locale, DateTimeLength.Medium);

console.log(formatter.formatIso(date));
```

```shell
node index.mjs
# Do., 02.01.2025
```
