//! This exists as a separate crate to work around
//! cargo being [unable to conditionally compile crate-types](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4881).
//!
//! This leads to problems like emscripten being unable to link
//! because symbols like log_js are not defined even if the crate_type
//! is not actually desired. As a workaround, the capi_staticlib and capi_dylib
//! crates exist as endpoints to be built when those respective library types are needed.
