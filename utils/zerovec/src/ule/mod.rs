///
/// Safety checklist for `ULE`:
///
/// 1. The type *must not* include any uninitialized or padding bytes.
/// 2. The type must have an alignment of 1 byte.
/// 3. The impl of [`ULE::validate_byte_slice()`] *must* return an error if the given byte slice
///    would not represent a valid slice of this type.
/// 4. The impl of [`ULE::validate_byte_slice()`] *must* return an error if the given byte slice
///    cannot be used in its entirety (if its length is not a multiple of `size_of::<Self>()`).
/// 5. All other methods *must* be left with their default impl, or else implemented according to
///    their respective safety guidelines.
/// 6. Acknowledge the following note about the equality invariant.
///
/// If the ULE type is a struct only containing other ULE types (or other types which satisfy invariants 1 and 2,
/// like `[u8; N]`), invariants 1 and 2 can be achieved via `#[repr(packed)]` or `#[repr(transparent)]`.
///
/// # Equality invariant
///
/// A non-safety invariant is that if `Self` implements `PartialEq`, the it *must* be logically
/// equivalent to byte equality on [`Self::as_byte_slice()`].
///
/// It may be necessary to introduce a "canonical form" of the ULE if logical equality does not
/// equal byte equality. In such a case, [`Self::validate_byte_slice()`] should return an error
/// for any values that are not in canonical form. For example, the decimal strings "1.23e4" and
/// "12.3e3" are logically equal, but not byte-for-byte equal, so we could define a canonical form
/// where only a single digit is allowed before `.`.

/// Failure to follow this invariant will cause surprising behavior in `PartialEq`, which may
/// result in unpredictable operations on `ZeroVec`, `VarZeroVec`, and `ZeroMap`.
