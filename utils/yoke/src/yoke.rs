/// A Cow-like borrowed object "yoked" to its backing data.
///
/// This allows things like zero copy deserialized data to carry around
/// shared references to their backing buffer.
///
/// `Y` (the [`Yokeable`]) is the object containing the references,
/// and will typically be of the form `Foo<'static>`. The `'static` is
/// not the actual lifetime of the data, rather it is a convenient way to erase
/// the lifetime and make it dynamic.
///
/// `C` is the "cart", which `Y` may contain references to.
///
/// The primary constructor for [`Yoke`] is [`Yoke::attach_to_cart()`]. Several variants of that
/// constructor are provided to serve numerous types of call sites and `Yoke` signatures.
///
/// In general, `C` is a concrete type, but it is also possible for it to be a trait object;
/// for more information, see [`IsCovariant`].
///
/// # Example
///
/// For example, we can use this to store zero-copy deserialized data in a cache:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use yoke::{Yoke, Yokeable};
/// # use std::rc::Rc;
/// # use std::borrow::Cow;
/// # fn load_from_cache(_filename: &str) -> Rc<[u8]> {
/// #     // dummy implementation
/// #     Rc::new([0x5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f])

/// What we want this function to do is take a Yokeable (`Y`) that is borrowing from the cart, and

/// hazards here:
///
/// - `P` ends up borrowing data from `Y` (or elsewhere) that did _not_ come from the cart,
///   for example `P` could borrow owned data from a `Cow`. This would make the `Yoke<P>` dependent
///   on data owned only by the `Yoke<Y>`.
/// - Borrowed data from `Y` escapes with the wrong lifetime
///
/// Let's walk through these and see how they're prevented.
///
/// ```rust, compile_fail
/// # use std::rc::Rc;
/// # use yoke::Yoke;
/// # use std::borrow::Cow;
/// fn borrow_potentially_owned(y: &Yoke<Cow<'static, str>, Rc<[u8]>>) -> Yoke<&'static str, Rc<[u8]>> {
///    y.project_cloned(|cow, _| &*cow)   
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this case, the lifetime of `&*cow` is `&'this str`, however the function needs to be able to return
/// `&'a str` _for all `'a`_, which isn't possible.
///
///
/// ```rust, compile_fail
/// # use std::rc::Rc;
/// # use yoke::Yoke;
/// # use std::borrow::Cow;
/// fn borrow_potentially_owned(y: Yoke<Cow<'static, str>, Rc<[u8]>>) -> Yoke<&'static str, Rc<[u8]>> {
///    y.project(|cow, _| &*cow)   
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This has the same issue, `&*cow` is borrowing for a local lifetime.
///
/// Similarly, trying to project an owned field of a struct will produce similar errors:

/// Borrowed data from `Y` similarly cannot escape with the wrong lifetime because of the `for<'a>`, since

/// uses `.get()`, however the signature forces the callers to be able to handle every lifetime.
///
///  `'a` is the only lifetime that matters here; `Yokeable`s must be `'static` and since

/// `Yoke`s can get additional lifetimes via the cart, and indeed, `project()` can operate on `Yoke<_, &'b [u8]>`,
/// however this lifetime is inaccessible to the closure, and even if it were accessible the `for<'a>` would force
/// it out of the output. All external lifetimes (from other found outside the yoke/closures
