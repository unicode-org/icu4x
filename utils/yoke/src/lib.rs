//! This crate provides [`Yoke`], a data structure that allows one
//! to "yoke" Cow-like borrowed data types to their backing storage,
//! enabling one to use Cow (etc) in zero-copy deserialization
//! with dynamic lifetimes for the borrowed data, for example caching it.
//!
//! See the documentation of [`Yoke`] for more details.

// The lifetimes here are important for safety and explicitly writing
// them out is good even when redundant
#![allow(clippy::needless_lifetimes)]
