# yoke [![crates.io](http://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/yoke)](https://crates.io/crates/yoke)

This crate provides [`Yoke`], a data structure that allows one
to "yoke" Cow-like borrowed data types to their backing storage,
enabling one to use Cow (etc) in zero-copy deserialization
with dynamic lifetimes for the borrowed data, for example caching it.

See the documentation of [`Yoke`] for more details.
