//! `writeable` is a utility crate of the [`ICU4X`] project.
//!
//! It includes [`Writeable`], a core trait representing an object that can be written to a
//! sink implementing std::fmt::Write. It is an alternative to std::fmt::Display with the
//! addition of a function indicating the number of bytes to be written.
//!
//! Writeable improves upon std::fmt::Display in two ways:
//!
//! 1. More efficient, since the sink can pre-allocate bytes.
//! 2. Smaller code, since the format machinery can be short-circuited.
//!
//! Types implementing Writeable have a defaulted writeable_to_string function.
//! If desired, types implementing Writeable can manually implement ToString
//! to wrap writeable_to_string.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use writeable::Writeable;
//! use writeable::assert_writeable_eq;
//! use std::fmt;
//!
//! struct WelcomeMessage<'s>{
//!     pub name: &'s str,
//! }
//!
//! impl<'s> Writeable for WelcomeMessage<'s> {
//!     fn write_to(&self, sink: &mut dyn fmt::Write) -> fmt::Result {
//!         sink.write_str("Hello, ")?;
//!         sink.write_str(self.name)?;
//!         sink.write_char('!')?;
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//!
//!     fn write_len(&self) -> usize {
//!         // "Hello, " + '!' + length of name
//!         8 + self.name.len()
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let message = WelcomeMessage { name: "Alice" };
//! assert_writeable_eq!("Hello, Alice!", &message);
//! ```

/// The macro tests for equality of both string content and string length. If your Writeable
/// implementation returns an inexact string length, don't use this macro.

/// ```
/// use writeable::Writeable;
/// use writeable::assert_writeable_eq;
/// use std::fmt;
///
/// struct Demo;
/// impl Writeable for Demo {
///     fn write_to(&self, sink: &mut dyn fmt::Write) -> fmt::Result {
