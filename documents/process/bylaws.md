ICU4X-SC Bylaws
===============

ICU4X-SC abides by the bylaws listed in this document.

## Decision Making

### Technical Decisions

ICU4X-TC maintains a collection of explainers (design documents) that are used as a basis for technical decisions.  All explainers that have been approved by ICU4X-SC live as Markdown files on GitHub.  *Designs are not official unless they are in an explainer checked-in to GitHub.*

An ICU4X-SC delegate may open a pull request to add new explainers or modify existing ones.  The pull request must receive approval at an official ICU4X-SC meeting, at which point it can be merged.

### Amending These Bylaws

The same process for adding or modifying explainers should be used for modifying these bylaws.

## Communication Channels

### Public Channels

The following subject matter *must* be discussed in public communication channels:

- Technical discussions that materially influence the trajectory of ICU4X

Public communication channels include:

- GitHub Issues
- Official ICU4X-SC meetings

### Back Channels

The following subject matter *may* be discussed in other communication channels:

- Logistics
    - e.g., event scheduling
- Work Planning
    - e.g., bug triage
- Clarifying Questions
    - i.e., specific questions which one's technical knowledge can help answer, like how to debug an error in Rust
- Rapid Prototyping
    - i.e., brainstorming that leads to a well-reasoned post in a public channel

Back channels include:

- Email
- Slack
- Google docs
- Unofficial meetings

If back-channel discussions become technical, such that they may influence the trajectory of ICU4X, they should be moved to GitHub.
