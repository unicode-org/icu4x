# ICU4X-TC Meeting: 2024-03-14

Present: Google, Amazon

## TC proposal

We create a new WG within ICU4X-TC called ICU4X-WG, the weekly meeting is a WG meeting. The working group behaves the same, where we merge changes, etc. Once before every release we convene an ICU4X-TC meeting in which at least 2 member organizations must attend, where we review the changelog and agree to ship that as a release.

Consensus: Above proposal.
