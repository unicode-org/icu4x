# icu [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/icu)](https://crates.io/crates/icu)

`icu` is the main meta-crate of the `ICU4X` project.

It provides a comprehensive selection of
[Unicode Internationalization Components](http://site.icu-project.org/)
in their canonical configurations intended to enable software
internationalization capabilities.

This crate does not bring any unique functionality. Each module is also
available as a stand-alone crate, i.e. `icu::list` as `icu_list`.

## Data Management

Most functionality relies on data which clients have to provide to the APIs.

`ICU4X` uses the concept of a [`DataProvider`] to separate data from logic.
Data providers come in many different forms; the following providers are provided
by `ICU4X` in separate crates:
* [`BlobDataProvider`]: uses an in-memory serde-serialized blob. This is the most flexible provider, and
  data can be updated at runtime.
* `BakedDataProvider`: a code-generated provider that contains the data directly in Rust code. This is
  the most efficient provider as it's serialization-free, and allows for compile-time optimizations.
* [`FsDataProvider`]: uses a file system tree of Serde files. This is mostly useful for development and
  not recommended in production for performance reasons.
* [`icu_provider_adapters`]: this crate contains APIs to combine providers or
  provide additional functionality such as locale fallback.

The data that is required by these providers (in `BakedDataProvider`'s case, the provider itself) can be
generated and customized using the [`icu_datagen`] crate.

The following example uses the [`icu_testdata`] crate, which contains prepackaged data providers
for a small set of locales.

## Example

```rust
use icu::datetime::{mock::parse_gregorian_from_str, options::length, TypedDateTimeFormatter};
use icu::locid::locale;

let provider = icu_testdata::get_provider();

let options =
    length::Bag::from_date_time_style(length::Date::Long, length::Time::Medium).into();

let dtf = TypedDateTimeFormatter::try_new_with_buffer_provider(&provider, &locale!("es").into(), options)
    .expect("Failed to create TypedDateTimeFormatter instance.");

let date = parse_gregorian_from_str("2020-09-12T12:35:00").expect("Failed to parse date.");

let formatted_date = dtf.format(&date);
assert_eq!(
    formatted_date.to_string(),
    "12 de septiembre de 2020, 12:35:00"
);
```

## Features

ICU4X components share a set of common features that control whether core pieces of
functionality are compiled. These features are:

- `std`: Whether to include `std` support. Without this feature, `icu` is `#[no_std]`-compatible
- `serde`: Whether to include `serde::Deserialize` implementations for data structs, such as [`SymbolsV1`],
  and `serde::{Serialize, Deserialize}` implementations for core libary types, such as [`Locale`]. These are
  required with `serde`-backed providers like [`BlobDataProvider`][^1].
- `experimental`: Whether to enable experimental preview features. Modules enabled with
  this feature may not be production-ready and could change at any time.

The following features are only available on the individual crates, but not on this meta-crate:
- `datagen`: Whether to implement `serde::Serialize` and functionality that is only required during data generation.
- `bench`: Whether to enable exhaustive benchmarks. This can be enabled on individual crates
  when running `cargo bench`.

[^1]: [`FsDataProvider`] also requires the `serde_human` feature if JSON is used, as that data is less
      preprocessed.
