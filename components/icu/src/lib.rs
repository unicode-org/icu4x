//! `icu` is the main meta-crate of the `ICU4X` project.
//!
//! It provides a comprehensive selection of functionality found in
//! [International Components for Unicode](http://icu.unicode.org/)
//! in their canonical configurations intended to enable software
//! internationalization capabilities.
//!
//! This crate exists to collect the most important functionality for users
//! together in one place.
//! It does not bring any unique functionality, but rather,
//! it re-exports the relevant crates as modules.
//! The exported crate corresponding to each module is also
//! available in a stand-alone manner, i.e. `icu::list` as `icu::list`.
//!
//! # Data Management
//!
//! Most internationalization algorithms are data-driven based on surveys of locale experts.
//! ICU4X offers multiple ways to manage locale data: many clients can start by using the
//! extensive data compiled into the library, while users with additional requirements can
//! provide data explicitly using [`DataProvider`]s.
//!
//! ## Compiled data
//!
//! Compiled data is exposed through idiomatic Rust constructors like `new` or `try_new`:
//!
//! ```
//! use icu::datetime::DateTimeFormatter;
//! use icu::locid::locale;
//!
//! let dtf = DateTimeFormatter::try_new(
//!     &locale!("es-US").into(),
//!     Default::default(),
//! )
//! .expect("compiled data should include 'es-US'");
//! ```
//!
//! Clients using compiled data benefit from simple code and optimal zero-cost data loading. Additionally,
//! ICU4X's APIs are designed such that dead-code elimination can optimize away unused compiled data.
//!
//! By default, most of the data available in [CLDR] is included. Users can customize data by using
//! the `icu4x-datagen` tool (with the `-‚Å†-format mod` flag) to, for example, select a smaller set of
//! locales, and then compiling with the `ICU4X_DATA_DIR` variable.
//!
//! ## Explicit data
//!
//! Powerful data management is possible with [`DataProvider`]s, which are passed to ICU4X APIs via
//! special constructors:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use icu::datetime::DateTimeFormatter;
//! use icu::locid::locale;
//! use icu_provider_adapters::fallback::LocaleFallbackProvider;
//! use icu_provider_blob::BlobDataProvider;
//!
//! let data: Box<[u8]> = todo!();
//!
//! let provider = BlobDataProvider::try_new_from_blob(data)
//!     .expect("data should be valid");
//!
//! let provider =
//!     LocaleFallbackProvider::try_new_with_buffer_provider(provider)
//!         .expect("provider should include fallback data");
//!
//! let dtf = DateTimeFormatter::try_new_with_buffer_provider(
//!     &provider,
//!     &locale!("es-US").into(),
//!     Default::default(),
//! )
//! .expect("data should include 'es-US', 'es', or 'und'");
//! ```
//!
//! Explicit data management can be used if the compiled-data constructors are too limiting. It allows:
//! * Accessing data without fallback
//! * Custom [`DataProvider`]s backed by sources like the operating system
//! * Lazily loading or updating data from I/O
//! * Composing data providers from different sources
//! * Manually including/excluding data
//! * ... and more. See our [data management tutorial]
//!
//! The following [`DataProvider`]s are available in separate crates:
//! * [`BlobDataProvider`]: deserializes data from an in-memory blob, which can be updated at runtime.
//! * `BakedDataProvider`: a code-generated provider that contains the data directly in Rust code. This is the
//!   same provider that is used internally by compiled data.
//! * [`FsDataProvider`]: uses a file system tree of Serde files. This is mostly useful for development and
//!   not recommended in production for performance reasons.
//! * [`icu_provider_adapters`]: this crate contains provider adapters to combine providers,
//!   provide additional functionality such as locale fallback, and more.
//!
//! The data that is required by these providers (in `BakedDataProvider`'s case, the provider itself) can be
//! generated and customized using the [`icu4x-datagen`] tool.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! ICU4X components share a set of common Cargo features that control whether core pieces of
//! functionality are compiled. These features are:
//!
//! - `compiled_data` (default): Whether to include compiled data. Without this flag, only constructors with
//!    explicit `provider` arguments are available.
//! - `std`: Whether to include `std` support. Without this Cargo feature, `icu` is `#[no_std]`-compatible.
//! - `sync`: makes most ICU4X objects implement `Send + Sync`. Has a small performance impact when used with non-static data.
//! - `logging`: Enables logging through the `log` crate.
//! - `serde`: Activates `serde` implementations for core library types, such as [`Locale`], as well
//!    as `*_with_buffer_provider` constructors for explicit data management.
//!
//! The following Cargo features are only available on the individual crates, but not on this meta-crate:
//!
//! - `datagen`: Whether to implement functionality that is only required during data generation.
//! - `bench`: Whether to enable exhaustive benchmarks. This can be enabled on individual crates
//!   when running `cargo bench`.
//!
//! # Experimental modules
//!
//! Experimental, unstable functionality can be found in the `icu::experimental` crate. The modules in that crate
//! are on track to be eventually stabilized into this crate.
