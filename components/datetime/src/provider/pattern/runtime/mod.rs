//! Runtime `Pattern` implementation which is optimized for zero-allocation
//! deserialization and high-performance runtime use in `DateTimeFormatter`.
//!
//! This module is meant to remain an implementation detail and can evolve to
//! utilize all runtime performance optimizations `ICU4X` needs.
//!
//! For all spec compliant behaviors see `reference::Pattern` equivalent.
