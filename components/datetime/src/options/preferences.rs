//! Preferences is a bag of options to be associated with either [`length::Bag`] or [`components::Bag`]
//! which provides information on user preferences that can affect the result of the formatting.
//!
//! [`length::Bag`]: crate::options::length::Bag
//! [`components::Bag`]: crate::options::components::Bag
//!
//! # Unicode Extensions
//! User preferences will often be stored as part of the [`Locale`] identified as `Unicode Extensions`, but
//! for scenarios where the application stores information about user preferences they can be also provided via
//! this bag (and if they are, they will take precedence over unicode extensions from the locale).
//!
//! [`Locale`]: icu_locid::Locale
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use icu::datetime::options::preferences;
//!
//! let prefs = preferences::Bag {
//!     hour_cycle: Some(preferences::HourCycle::H23)
//! };
//! ```
