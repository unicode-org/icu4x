//! Preferences is a bag of options to be associated with either `Style` or `Components` bag which provides
//! information on user preferences that can affect the result of the formatting.
//!
//! # Unicode Extensions
//! User preferences will often be stored as part of the `Locale` identified as `Unicode Extensions`, but
//! for scenarios where the application stores information about user preferences they can be also provided via
//! this bag (and if they are, they will take precedence over unicode extensions from the locale).
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use icu_datetime::options::preferences;
//!
//! let prefs = preferences::Bag {
//!     hour_cycle: Some(preferences::HourCycle::H23)
//! };
//! ```
