//! Duration formatting

/// Represents a duration of time (intuitively, how long something took / will take).
/// Can be constructed ergonomically using the [`Default`] trait like so:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use icu_experimental::duration::Duration;
/// let d = Duration {
///     years: 1,
///     months: 2,
///     weeks: 3,
///     ..Default::default()
/// };
/// ```
#[allow(clippy::exhaustive_structs)] // this type should be stable (and is intended to be constructed manually)
#[derive(Debug, Default, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
