# icu_experimental [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/icu_experimental)](https://crates.io/crates/icu_experimental)

<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

🚧 The experimental development module of the `ICU4X` project.

This module is published as its own crate ([`icu_experimental`](https://docs.rs/icu_experimental/latest/icu_experimental/))
and as part of the [`icu`](https://docs.rs/icu/latest/icu/) crate. See the latter for more details on the ICU4X project.

It will usually undergo a major `SemVer` bump for every ICU4X release. Components in this
crate will eventually stabilize and move to their own top-level components.
