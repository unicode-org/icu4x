Welcome to the home page for the `ICU4X` project.

`ICU4X` provides components enabling wide range of software internationalization.
It draws deeply from the experience of [`ICU4C`](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/released/icu4c/), [`ICU4J`](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/released/icu4j/) and [`ECMA-402`](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/) and relies on data from the [`CLDR`](http://cldr.unicode.org/) project.

The design goals of `ICU4X` are:

* Small and modular code
* Pluggable locale data
* Availability and ease of use in multiple programming languages
* Written by internationalization experts to encourage best practices

## Documentation

For an introduction to the project, please visit the ["Introduction to ICU4X for Rust"](tutorials/intro.md) tutorial. Further tutorials can be found in the [tutorial index](tutorials/index.md).

For technical information on how to use ICU4X, visit our [API docs (latest stable)](https://docs.rs/icu/latest/) or [API docs (tip of main)](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu4x/rustdoc/icu/).

More information about the project can be found in [the documents subdirectory](documents/README.md).

## Quick Start

An example `ICU4X` powered application in Rust may look like below...

`Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icu = "1.5.0"
```

`src/main.rs`:

```rust
use icu::calendar::DateTime;
use icu::datetime::{options::length, DateTimeFormatter};
use icu::locale::locale;

let options =
    length::Bag::from_date_time_style(length::Date::Long, length::Time::Medium).into();

let dtf = DateTimeFormatter::try_new(&locale!("es").into(), options)
    .expect("locale should be present in compiled data");

let date = DateTime::try_new_iso_datetime(2020, 9, 12, 12, 35, 0).expect("datetime should be valid");
let date = date.to_any();

let formatted_date = dtf.format_to_string(&date).expect("formatting should succeed");
assert_eq!(
    formatted_date,
    "12 de septiembre de 2020, 12:35:00"
);
```

## Development

ICU4X is developed by the ICU4X Technical Committee (ICU4X-TC) in the Unicode Consortium. The ICU4X-TC leads strategy and development of internationalization solutions for modern platforms and ecosystems, including client-side and resource-constrained environments. See [unicode.org](https://www.unicode.org/consortium/techchairs.html) for more information on our governance.

ICU4X-TC convenes approximately once per quarter in advance of ICU4X releases. Most work in the interim takes place in the ICU4X Working Group (ICU4X WG), which makes technical recommendations, lands them in the repository, and records them in CHANGELOG.md. The recommendations of ICU4X WG are subject to approval by the ICU4X-TC.

## Charter

*For the full charter, including answers to frequently asked questions, see [charter.md](documents/process/charter.md).*

ICU4X is a new project whose objective is to solve the needs of clients who wish to provide client-side internationalization for their products in resource-constrained environments.

ICU4X, or "ICU for X", will be built from the start with several key design constraints:

1. Small and modular code.
2. Pluggable locale data.
3. Availability and ease of use in multiple programming languages.
4. Written by internationalization experts to encourage best practices.

ICU4X will provide an ECMA-402-compatible API surface in the target client-side platforms, including the web platform, iOS, Android, WearOS, WatchOS, Flutter, and Fuchsia, supported in programming languages including Rust, JavaScript, Objective-C, Java, Dart, and C++.
