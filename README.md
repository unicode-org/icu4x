Welcome to **ICU4X**, a modern, modular, and lightweight internationalization library designed for a wide range of platforms and programming languages. ICU4X draws inspiration from [ICU4C](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/released/icu4c/), [ICU4J](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/released/icu4j/), and [ECMA-402](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/), and leverages data from the [CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/) project.

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Small, reusable components tailored for resource-constrained environments.  
- **Pluggable Locale Data**: Flexible data management to suit diverse use cases.  
- **Cross-Language Support**: Available in Rust, JavaScript, Java, Dart, C++, and more.  
- **Best Practices**: Built by internationalization experts to ensure robust and reliable solutions.

## Quick Start

Add ICU4X to your Rust project with `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
icu = "1.5.0"
```

Then, use ICU4X to format dates in your application:

```rust
use icu::calendar::Date;
use icu::datetime::{DateTimeFormatter, Length, fieldsets::YMD};
use icu::locale::locale;

fn main() {
    let dtf = DateTimeFormatter::try_new(
        locale!("es").into(),
        YMD::long()
    ).expect("Locale should be present in compiled data");

    let date = Date::try_new_iso(2020, 9, 12).expect("Date should be valid");
    let formatted_date = dtf.format(&date.to_any()).to_string();

    assert_eq!(formatted_date, "12 de septiembre de 2020");
    println!("Formatted Date: {}", formatted_date);
}
```
