# Note: Each of these jobs, except for the clippy job and the optional benchmarking/coverage
# jobs, maps to a `ci-job-foo` entry in Makefile.toml. If adding further CI jobs, please add them
# as makefile targets as well, and list them under `ci-all`.
#
# Clippy is special because we're using actions-rs/clippy-check which is able to surface clippy failures on
