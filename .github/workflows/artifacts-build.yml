# The CI action in this file is used to build the artifacts on pushes to a repository containing
# the ICU4X service account key. All steps are skipped unless the key is present.
#
# If you are a frequent contributor, you can add the key to your fork. The key is shared with
# icu4x collaborators and can be viewed here:
#
# https://drive.google.com/file/d/17-oMqRfuHOHL9hYp64NYOh8vcJ03DQHm/view
#
# To add the key, follow these steps:
#
# 1. Go to the secrets on your fork:
#     - https://github.com/{USER}/icu4x/settings/secrets/actions
# 2. Click "New repository secret" and enter the following information:
#     - Name: ICU4X_GCP_SA_KEY
#     - Value: The contents of the file linked above
# 3. Click "Add secret"
# 4. Re-run the latest "Artifacts Build" action on your fork to make sure it works:

    #   TODO(qnnokabayashi): This was my attempt to get it to copy the HTML to
    #     the `gh-pages` branch. As of 8/1/2022, idea is that
    #     `index.html` contains the structure for
    #     the demo. It needs to call into the Webpacked JavaScript. When testing
    #     locally, this content is in `dist/`, but
    #     when deployed, it lives in Google Cloud Storage. But we don't want to
    #     be editing this arbitrarily complex HTML file in CI. The solution was
    #     to have it call a very simple `index.js` file which modifies the HTML
    #     and tells it where to get the script from. Locally, this lives next to
    #     `index.html` at `index.js`, and contains
    #     the following:
    #       ```js
    #       const gcs = document.createElement('script');
    #       gcs.setAttribute('src', './dist/bundle.js');
    #       document.body.appendChild(gcs);
    #       ```
    #     The plan was to rewrite this file in CI to point into GCS instead of
    #     `./dist/bundle.js`, and then commit and push the original `index.html`
    #     and this new `index.js` to the `gh-pages` branch. That way, when a
    #     browser visited the Github page, `index.html` would read `index.js`,
    #     which would then point the browser to get `bundle.js` from GCS.
    #     
    #     This was my attempt to make that work, but I couldn't quite figure out
    #     how to push to `gh-pages`.
