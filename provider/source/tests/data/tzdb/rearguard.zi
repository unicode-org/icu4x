# 2009-05-17 by Arthur David Olson.

# From Paul Eggert (2018-05-27):
#
# Unless otherwise specified, the source for data through 1990 is:
# Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
# Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.
#
# Many years ago Gwillim Law wrote that a good source
# for time zone data was the International Air Transport
# Association's Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
# published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
# of the IATA's data after 1990.  Except where otherwise noted,
# IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
#
# Another source occasionally used is Edward W. Whitman, World Time Differences,
# Whitman Publishing Co, 2 Niagara Av, Ealing, London (undated), which
# I found in the UCLA library.
#
# For data circa 1899, a common source is:
# Milne J. Civil time. Geogr J. 1899 Feb;13(2):173-94.
# https://www.jstor.org/stable/1774359
#
# For the 1911/1912 establishment of standard time in French possessions, see:
# Société Française de Physique, Recueil de constantes physiques (1913),
# page 752, 18b.
#
# European-style abbreviations are commonly used along the Mediterranean.
# For sub-Saharan Africa abbreviations were less standardized.
# Previous editions of this database used WAT, CAT, SAT, and EAT
# for UT +00 through +03, respectively,
# but in 1997 Mark R V Murray reported that
# 'SAST' is the official abbreviation for +02 in the country of South Africa,
# 'CAT' is commonly used for +02 in countries north of South Africa, and
# 'WAT' is probably the best name for +01, as the common phrase for
# the area that includes Nigeria is "West Africa".
#
# To summarize, the following abbreviations seemed to have some currency:
#	 +00	GMT	Greenwich Mean Time
#	 +02	CAT	Central Africa Time
#	 +02	SAST	South Africa Standard Time
# and Murray suggested the following abbreviation:
#	 +01	WAT	West Africa Time
# Murray's suggestion seems to have caught on in news reports and the like.
# I vaguely recall 'WAT' also being used for -01 in the past but
# cannot now come up with solid citations.
#
# I invented the following abbreviations in the 1990s:
#	 +02	WAST	West Africa Summer Time
#	 +03	CAST	Central Africa Summer Time
#	 +03	SAST	South Africa Summer Time
#	 +03	EAT	East Africa Time
# 'EAT' seems to have caught on and is in current timestamps, and though
# the other abbreviations are rarer and are only in past timestamps,
# they are paired with better-attested non-DST abbreviations.
# Corrections are welcome.

# From Abdelrahman Hassan (2007-09-06):
# Due to the Hijri (lunar Islamic calendar) year being 11 days shorter
# than the year of the Gregorian calendar, Ramadan shifts earlier each
# year. This year it will be observed September 13 (September is quite
# hot in Egypt), and the idea is to make fasting easier for workers by
# shifting business hours one hour out of daytime heat. Consequently,
# unless discontinued, next DST may end Thursday 28 August 2008.
# From Paul Eggert (2007-08-17):
# For lack of better info, assume the new rule is last Thursday in August.

# From Tim Parenti (2012-11-11):
# Treat the 2012-11-10 change as a zone change from UTC+2 to UTC+1.
# The DST rules planned for 2013 and onward roughly mirror those of Europe
# (either two days before them or five days after them, so as to fall on
# lastFri instead of lastSun).

# From Even Scharning (2013-10-25):
# The scheduled end of DST in Libya on Friday, October 25, 2013 was
# cancelled yesterday....

# Mauritius

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-06-25):
# Mauritius plans to observe DST from 2008-11-01 to 2009-03-31 on a trial
# basis....
# It seems that Mauritius observed daylight saving time from 1982-10-10 to
# 1983-03-20 as well, but that was not successful....
# https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/mauritius-daylight-saving-time.html

# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-06-25):
# http://economicdevelopment.gov.mu/portal/site/Mainhomepage/menuitem.a42b24128104d9845dabddd154508a0c/?content_id=0a7cee8b5d69a110VgnVCM1000000a04a8c0RCRD

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-06-30):
# The www.timeanddate.com article cited by Steffen Thorsen notes that "A
# final decision has yet to be made on the times that daylight saving
# would begin and end on these dates." As a place holder, use midnight.

# From Paul Eggert (2008-06-30):
# Follow Thorsen on DST in 1982/1983, instead of Shanks & Pottenger.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-07-10):
# According to
# http://www.lexpress.mu/display_article.php?news_id=111216
# (in French), Mauritius will start and end their DST a few days earlier
# than previously announced (2008-11-01 to 2009-03-31).  The new start
# date is 2008-10-26 at 02:00 and the new end date is 2009-03-27 (no time
# given, but it is probably at either 2 or 3 wall clock time).
#
# A little strange though, since the article says that they moved the date
# to align itself with Europe and USA which also change time on that date,
# but that means they have not paid attention to what happened in
# USA/Canada last year (DST ends first Sunday in November). I also wonder
# why that they end on a Friday, instead of aligning with Europe which
# changes two days later.

# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-07-11):
# Seems that English language article "The revival of daylight saving
# time: Energy conservation?"- No. 16578 (07/11/2008) was originally
# published on Monday, June 30, 2008...
#
# I guess that article in French "Le gouvernement avance l'introduction
# de l'heure d'été" stating that DST in Mauritius starting on October 26
# and ending on March 27, 2009 is the most recent one....

# Cabinet Decision of July 18th, 2008 states as follows:
#
# 4. ...Cabinet has agreed to the introduction into the National Assembly
# of the Time Bill which provides for the introduction of summer time in
# Mauritius. The summer time period which will be of one hour ahead of
# the standard time, will be aligned with that in Europe and the United
# States of America. It will start at two o'clock in the morning on the
# last Sunday of October and will end at two o'clock in the morning on
# the last Sunday of March the following year. The summer time for the
# year 2008-2009 will, therefore, be effective as from 26 October 2008
# and end on 29 March 2009.

#
# Saturday night May 31st at midnight (which in French is to be

# Sunday night the 28th at midnight
#
# Seeing that the 28th is Monday, I am guessing that she intends to say

#
# From Milamber (2020-05-31)
# In Morocco (where I live), the end of Ramadan (Arabic month) is followed by
# the Eid al-Fitr, and concretely it's 1 or 2 day offs for the people (with
# traditional visiting of family, big lunches/dinners, etc.).  So for this
# year the astronomical calculations don't include the following 2 days off in
# the calc.  These 2 days fall in a Sunday/Monday, so it's not acceptable by
# people to have a time shift during these 2 days off.  Perhaps you can modify
# the (predicted) rules for next years: if the end of Ramadan is a (probable)
# Friday or Saturday (and so the 2 days off are on a weekend), the next time
# shift will be the next weekend.

# From Paul Eggert (2024-05-24):
# The London Gazette, 1903-04-03, page 2245, says that
# as of 1903-03-03 a time ball at the port of Lourenço Marques
# (as Maputo was then called) was dropped daily at 13:00:00 LMT,
# corresponding to 22:49:41.7 GMT, so local time was +02:10:18.3.
# Conversely, the newspaper South Africa, 1909-02-09, page 321,
# says the port had just installed an apparatus that communicated
# "from the controlling clock in the new Observatory at Reuben Point ...
# exact mean South African time, i.e., 30 deg., or 2 hours East of Greenwich".
# Although Shanks gives 1903-03-01 for the transition to CAT,
# evidently the port transitioned to CAT after 1903-03-03 but before
# the Portuguese legal transition of 1912-01-01 (see Europe/Lisbon commentary).
# For lack of better info, list 1909 as the transition date.

# Namibia

# From Arthur David Olson (2017-08-09):
# The text of the "Namibia Time Act, 1994" is available online at
# www.lac.org.na/laws/1994/811.pdf
# and includes this nugget:
# Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2) of section 1, the
# first winter period after the commencement of this Act shall
# commence at OOhOO on Monday 21 March 1994 and shall end at 02h00 on
# Sunday 4 September 1994.

# From Michael Deckers (2017-04-06):
# ... both summer and winter time are called "standard"
# (which differs from the use in Ireland) ...

# From Petronella Sibeene (2007-03-30):
# http://allafrica.com/stories/200703300178.html
# While the entire country changes its time, Katima Mulilo and other
# settlements in Caprivi unofficially will not because the sun there
# rises and sets earlier compared to other regions.  Chief of
# Forecasting Riaan van Zyl explained that the far eastern parts of
# the country are close to 40 minutes earlier in sunrise than the rest
# of the country.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-02-22):
# Although the Zambezi Region (formerly known as Caprivi) informally
# observes Botswana time, we have no details about historical practice.
# In the meantime people there can use Africa/Gaborone.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2017-08-09):
# Namibia is going to change their time zone to what is now their DST:
# https://www.newera.com.na/2017/02/23/namibias-winter-time-might-be-repealed/
# This video is from the government decision:
# https://www.nbc.na/news/na-passes-namibia-time-bill-repealing-1994-namibia-time-act.8665
# We have made the assumption so far that they will change their time zone at
# the same time they would normally start DST, the first Sunday in September:
# https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/namibia-new-time-zone.html

# From Paul Eggert (2017-04-09):
# Before the change, summer and winter time were both standard time legally.
# However in common parlance, winter time was considered to be DST.  See, e.g.:

# From P Chan (2020-12-03):
# GMT was adopted as the standard time of Lagos on 1905-07-01.
# Lagos Weekly Record, 1905-06-24, p 3
# http://ddsnext.crl.edu/titles/31558#?c=0&m=668&s=0&cv=2&r=0&xywh=1446,5221,1931,1235
# says "It is officially notified that on and after the 1st of July 1905
# Greenwich Mean Solar Time will be adopted throughout the Colony and
# Protectorate, and that it will be necessary to put all clocks 13 minutes and
# 35 seconds back, recording local mean time."
#
# It seemed that Lagos returned to LMT on 1908-07-01.
# [The Lagos Standard], 1908-07-01, p 5

# says "Scarcely have the people become accustomed to this new time, when
# another official notice has now appeared announcing that from and after the
# 1st July next, return will be made to local mean time."
#
# From P Chan (2020-11-27):
# On 1914-01-01, standard time of GMT+0:30 was adopted for the unified Nigeria.
# Colonial Reports - Annual. No. 878. Nigeria. Report for 1914. (April 1916),

# "On January 1st [1914], a universal standard time for Nigeria was adopted,
# viz., half an hour fast on Greenwich mean time, corresponding to the meridian
# 7° 30' E. long."
# Lloyd's Register of Shipping (1915) says "Hitherto the time observed in Lagos
# was the local mean time. On 1st January, 1914, standard time for the whole of
# Nigeria was introduced ... Lagos time has been advanced about 16 minutes
# accordingly."
#
# In 1919, standard time was changed to GMT+1.
# Interpretation Ordinance (Cap 2)
# The Laws of Nigeria, Containing the Ordinances of Nigeria, in Force on the
# 1st Day of January, 1923, Vol.I [p 16]
# https://books.google.com/books?id=BOMrAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA16
# "The expression 'Standard time' means standard time as used in Nigeria:
# namely, 60 minutes in advance of Greenwich mean time.  (As amended by 18 of
# 1919, s. 2.)"
# From Tim Parenti (2020-12-10):
# The Lagos Weekly Record, 1919-09-20, p 3 details discussion on the first
# reading of this Bill by the Legislative Council of the Colony of Nigeria on
# Thursday 1919-08-28:
# http://ddsnext.crl.edu/titles/31558?terms&item_id=303484#?m=1118&c=1&s=0&cv=2&r=0&xywh=1261,3408,2994,1915
# "The proposal is that the Globe should be divided into twelve zones East and
# West of Greenwich, of one hour each, Nigeria falling into the zone with a
# standard of one hour fast on Greenwich Mean Time.  Nigeria standard time is
# now 30 minutes in advance of Greenwich Mean Time ... according to the new
# proposal, standard time will be advanced another 30 minutes".  It was further
# proposed that the firing of the time guns likewise be adjusted by 30 minutes
# to compensate.
# From Tim Parenti (2020-12-10), per P Chan (2020-12-11):
# The text of Ordinance 18 of 1919, published in Nigeria Gazette, Vol 6, No 52,
# shows that the change was assented to the following day and took effect "on
# the 1st day of September, 1919."

# Tunisia

# From Gwillim Law (2005-04-30):
# My correspondent, Risto Nykänen, has alerted me to another adoption of DST,
# this time in Tunisia.  According to Yahoo France News
# <http://fr.news.yahoo.com/050426/5/4dumk.html>, in a story attributed to AP
# and dated 2005-04-26, "Tunisia has decided to advance its official time by
# one hour, starting on Sunday, May 1.  Henceforth, Tunisian time will be
# UTC+2 instead of UTC+1.  The change will take place at 23:00 UTC next
# Saturday."  (My translation)
#
# From Oscar van Vlijmen (2005-05-02):
# La Presse, the first national daily newspaper ...
# http://www.lapresse.tn/archives/archives280405/actualites/lheure.html
# ... DST for 2005: on: Sun May 1 0h standard time, off: Fri Sept. 30,
# 1h standard time.
#
# From Atef Loukil (2006-03-28):
# The daylight saving time will be the same each year:
# Beginning      : the last Sunday of March at 02:00
# Ending         : the last Sunday of October at 03:00 ...
# http://www.tap.info.tn/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1188&Itemid=50

# From Steffen Thorsen (2009-03-16):
# According to several news sources, Tunisia will not observe DST this year.
# (Arabic)
# http://www.elbashayer.com/?page=viewn&nid=42546
# https://www.babnet.net/kiwidetail-15295.asp
#
# We have also confirmed this with the US embassy in Tunisia.
# We have a wrap-up about this on the following page:
# https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/tunisia-cancels-dst-2009.html

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2009-03-17):

#
# (in Arabic)
# http://www.tap.info.tn/ar/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=61240&Itemid=1

# From Arthur David Olson (2009-03-18):
# The Tunis Afrique Presse News Agency notice contains this: "This measure is
# due to the fact that the fasting month of Ramadan coincides with the period
# concerned by summer time.  Therefore, the standard time will be kept
# unchanged the whole year long."  So foregoing DST seems to be an exception
# (albeit one that may be repeated in the future).

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2010-03-27):
# According to some news reports Tunis confirmed not to use DST in 2010
#
# (translation):
# "The Tunisian government has decided to abandon DST, which was scheduled on
# Sunday...
# Tunisian authorities had suspended the DST for the first time last year also
# coincided with the month of Ramadan..."

# From Paul-Inge Flakstad (2014-03-10):
# I recently had a long dialog about this with the developer of timegenie.com.
# In the absence of specific dates, he decided to choose some likely ones:
#   GMT +1 - From March 1 to the last Sunday in March
#   GMT +2 - From the last Sunday in March until the last Sunday in October
#   GMT +1 - From the last Sunday in October until November 7
#   GMT +0 - From November 7 until March 1
# The dates for switching to and from UTC+0 will probably not be absolutely
# correct, but they should be quite close to the actual dates.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2014-03-21):
# The CET-switching Troll rules require zic from tz 2014b or later, so as
# suggested by Bengt-Inge Larsson comment them out for now, and approximate
# with only UTC and CEST.  Uncomment them when 2014b is more prevalent.

# Vostok, since 1957-12-16, temporarily closed 1994-02/1994-11
# From Craig Mundell (1994-12-15):
# http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/antarctica/QA/computers/Directions,Time,ZIP
# Vostok, which is one of the Russian stations, is set on the same
# time as Moscow, Russia.
#
# From Lee Hotz (2001-03-08):
# I queried the folks at Columbia who spent the summer at Vostok and this is
# what they had to say about time there:
# "in the US Camp (East Camp) we have been on New Zealand (McMurdo)
# time, which is 12 hours ahead of GMT. The Russian Station Vostok was
# 6 hours behind that (although only 2 miles away, i.e. 6 hours ahead
# of GMT). This is a time zone I think two hours east of Moscow. The
# natural time zone is in between the two: 8 hours ahead of GMT."
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-05-04):
# This seems to be hopelessly confusing, so I asked Lee Hotz about it
# in person.  He said that some Antarctic locations set their local
# time so that noon is the warmest part of the day, and that this
# changes during the year and does not necessarily correspond to mean
# solar noon.  So the Vostok time might have been whatever the clocks
# happened to be during their visit.  So we still don't really know what time
# it is at Vostok.
#
# From Zakhary V. Akulov (2023-12-17 22:00:48 +0700):
# ... from December, 18, 2023 00:00 by my decision the local time of
# the Antarctic research base Vostok will correspond to UTC+5.
# (2023-12-19): We constantly interact with Progress base, with company who
# builds new wintering station, with sledge convoys, with aviation - they all
# use UTC+5. Besides, difference between Moscow time is just 2 hours now, not 4.
# (2023-12-19, in response to the question "Has local time at Vostok
# been UTC+6 ever since 1957, or has it changed before?"): No. At least
# since my antarctic career start, 10 years ago, Vostok base has UTC+7.
# (In response to a 2023-12-18 question "from 02:00 to 00:00 today"): This.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2023-12-18):
# For lack of better info, guess Vostok was at +07 from founding through today,
# except when closed.

# One last quirk about South Pole time.
# All the electric clocks are usually wrong.
# Something about the generators running at 60.1hertz or something
# makes all of the clocks run fast.  So every couple of days,
# we have to go around and set them back 5 minutes or so.
# Maybe if we let them run fast all of the time, we'd get to leave here sooner!!

# The table lists dates only; I am guessing 00:00 and 24:00 transition times.
# Also, the table lists the planned end of DST in 1949, but the corresponding
# zone line cuts this off on May 28, when the Communists took power.

# From Phake Nick (2020-04-15):
#
# For the history of time in Shanghai between 1940-1942, the situation is
# actually slightly more complex than the table [below]....  At the time,
# there were three different authorities in Shanghai, including Shanghai
# International Settlement, a settlement established by western countries with
# its own westernized form of government, Shanghai French Concession, similar
# to the international settlement but is controlled by French, and then the
# rest of the city of Shanghai, which have already been controlled by Japanese
# force through a puppet local government (Wang Jingwei regime).  It was
# additionally complicated by the circumstances that, according to the 1940s
# Shanghai summer time essay cited in the database, some
# departments/businesses/people in the Shanghai city itself during that time
# period, refused to change their clock and instead only changed their opening
# hours.
#
# For example, as quoted in the article, in 1940, other than the authority
# itself, power, tram, bus companies, cinema, department stores, and other
# public service organizations have all decided to follow the summer time and
# spring forward the clock.  On the other hand, the custom office refused to
# spring forward the clock because of worry on mechanical wear to the physical
# clock, postal office refused to spring forward because of disruption to
# business and log-keeping, although they did changed their office hour to
# match rest of the city.  So is travel agents, and also weather
# observatory.  It is said both time standards had their own supporters in the
# city at the time, those who prefer new time standard would have moved their
# clock while those who prefer the old time standard would keep their clock
# unchange, and there were different clocks that use different time standard
# in the city at the time for people who use different time standard to adjust
# their clock to their preferred time.
#
# a. For the 1940 May 31 spring forward, the essay [says] ... "Hong
# Kong government implemented the spring forward in the same time on
# the same date as Shanghai".
#
# b. For the 1940 fall back, it was said that they initially intended to do
# so on September 30 00:59 at night, however they postponed it to October 12
# after discussion with relevant parties. However schools restored to the
# original schedule ten days earlier.
#
# c. For the 1941 spring forward, it is said to start from March 15
# "following the previous year's method", and in addition to that the essay
# cited an announcement in 1941 from the Wang regime which said the Special
# City of Shanghai under Wang regime control will follow the DST rule set by
# the Settlements, irrespective of the original DST plan announced by the Wang
# regime for other area under its control(April 1 to September 30). (no idea
# to situation before that announcement)
#
# d. For the 1941 fall back, it was said that the fall back would occurs at
# the end of September (A newspaper headline cited by the essay, published on
# October 1, 1941, have the headlines which said "French Concession would
# rewind to the old clock this morning), but it ultimately didn't happen due
# to disagreement between the international settlement authority and the
# French concession authority, and the fall back ultimately occurred on
# November 1.
#
# e. In 1941 December, Japan have officially started war with the United
# States and the United Kingdom, and in Shanghai they have marched into the
# international settlement, taken over its control
#
# f. For the 1942 spring forward, the essay said that the spring forward
# started on January 31. It said this time the custom office and postal
# department will also change their clocks, unlike before.
#
# g. The essay itself didn't cover any specific changes thereafter until the
# end of the war, it quoted a November 1942 command from the government of the
# Wang regime, which claim the daylight saving time applies year round during
# the war. However, the essay ambiguously said the period is "February 1 to
# September 30", which I don't really understand what is the meaning of such
# period in the context of year round implementation here.. More researches
# might be needed to show exactly what happened during that period of time.

# From Phake Nick (2020-04-15):
# According to a Japanese tour bus pamphlet in Nanjing area believed to be
# from around year 1941: http://www.tt-museum.jp/tairiku_0280_nan1941.html ,
# the schedule listed was in the format of Japanese time.  Which indicate some
# use of the Japanese time (instead of syncing by DST) might have occurred in
# the Yangtze river delta area during that period of time although the scope
# of such use will need to be investigated to determine.

# From Guy Harris:
# People's Republic of China.  Yes, they really have only one time zone.

# From Bob Devine (1988-01-28):
# No they don't.  See TIME mag, 1986-02-17 p.52.  Even though
# China is across 4 physical time zones, before Feb 1, 1986 only the
# Peking (Beijing) time zone was recognized.  Since that date, China
# has two of 'em - Peking's and Ürümqi (named after the capital of

# From Anthony Fok (2001-12-20):

#
# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2006-07-14):
# I have investigated the timezones around 1970 on the

# counties on the Sichuan side of the Xizang-Sichuan border,
# counties Dege and Baiyu which lies on the Sichuan side and are
# therefore supposed to be GMT+7, Xizang region being GMT+6, but Dege

# (could be true), for the moment I am assuming that those two

# From Paul Eggert (2017-01-05):
# Alois Treindl kindly sent me translations of the following two sources:
#
# (1)
# Guo Qing-sheng (National Time-Service Center, CAS, Xi'an 710600, China)
# Beijing Time at the Beginning of the PRC
# China Historical Materials of Science and Technology
# (Zhongguo ke ji shi liao, 中国科技史料). 2003;24(1):5-9.
# http://oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?filename=ZGKS200301000&dbname=CJFD2003
# It gives evidence that at the beginning of the PRC, Beijing time was
# officially apparent solar time!  However, Guo also says that the
# evidence is dubious, as the relevant institute of astronomy had not
# been taken over by the PRC yet.  It's plausible that apparent solar
# time was announced but never implemented, and that people continued
# to use UT+8.  As the Shanghai radio station (and I presume the
# observatory) was still under control of French missionaries, it
# could well have ignored any such mandate.
#
# (2)
# Guo Qing-sheng (Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory, CAS, Xi'an 710600, China)
# A Study on the Standard Time Changes for the Past 100 Years in China
# [undated and unknown publication location]
# It says several things:
#   * The Qing dynasty used local apparent solar time throughout China.
#   * The Republic of China instituted Beijing mean solar time effective
#     the official calendar book of 1914.
#   * The French Concession in Shanghai set up signal stations in
#     French docks in the 1890s, controlled by Xujiahui (Zikawei)
#     Observatory and set to local mean time.
#   * "From the end of the 19th century" it changed to UT+8.
#   * Chinese Customs (by then reduced to a tool of foreign powers)
#     eventually standardized on this time for all ports, and it
#     became used by railways as well.
#   * In 1918 the Central Observatory proposed dividing China into
#     five time zones (see below for details).  This caught on
#     at first only in coastal areas observing UT+8.
#   * During WWII all of China was in theory was at UT+7.  In practice
#     this was ignored in the west, and I presume was ignored in
#     Japanese-occupied territory.
#   * Japanese-occupied Manchuria was at UT+9, i.e., Japan time.
#   * The five-zone plan was resurrected after WWII and officially put into
#     place (with some modifications) in March 1948.  It's not clear
#     how well it was observed in areas under Nationalist control.
#   * The People's Liberation Army used UT+8 during the civil war.
#
# An AP article "Shanghai Internat'l Area Little Changed" in the
# Lewiston (ME) Daily Sun (1939-05-29), p 17, said "Even the time is
# different - the occupied districts going by Tokyo time, an hour
# ahead of that prevailing in the rest of Shanghai."  Guess that the
# Xujiahui Observatory was under French control and stuck with UT +08.
#
# In earlier versions of this file, China had many separate Zone entries, but
# this was based on what were apparently incorrect data in Shanks & Pottenger.
# This has now been simplified to the two entries Asia/Shanghai and
# Asia/Urumqi, with the others being links for backward compatibility.
# Proposed in 1918 and theoretically in effect until 1949 (although in practice
# mainly observed in coastal areas), the five zones were:
#
# Changbai Time ("Long-white Time", Long-white = Heilongjiang area) UT +08:30
# Now part of Asia/Shanghai; its pre-1970 times are not recorded here.
# Heilongjiang (except Mohe county), Jilin
#
# Zhongyuan Time ("Central plain Time") UT +08
# Now part of Asia/Shanghai.
# most of China
# Milne gives 8:05:43.2 for Xujiahui Observatory time....
# Guo says Shanghai switched to UT +08 "from the end of the 19th century".
#
# Long-shu Time (probably as Long and Shu were two names of the area) UT +07
# Now part of Asia/Shanghai; its pre-1970 times are not recorded here.
# Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Ningxia, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Yunnan;
# most of Gansu; west Inner Mongolia; east Qinghai; and the Guangdong
# counties Deqing, Enping, Kaiping, Luoding, Taishan, Xinxing,
# Yangchun, Yangjiang, Yu'nan, and Yunfu.
#
# Xin-zang Time ("Xinjiang-Tibet Time") UT +06
# This region is now part of either Asia/Urumqi or Asia/Shanghai with
# current boundaries uncertain; times before 1970 for areas that
# disagree with Ürümqi or Shanghai are not recorded here.
# The Gansu counties Aksay, Anxi, Dunhuang, Subei; west Qinghai;
# the Guangdong counties  Xuwen, Haikang, Suixi, Lianjiang,
# Zhanjiang, Wuchuan, Huazhou, Gaozhou, Maoming, Dianbai, and Xinyi;
# east Tibet, including Lhasa, Chamdo, Shigaise, Jimsar, Shawan and Hutubi;
# east Xinjiang, including Ürümqi, Turpan, Karamay, Korla, Minfeng, Jinghe,
# Wusu, Qiemo, Xinyan, Wulanwusu, Jinghe, Yumin, Tacheng, Tuoli, Emin,
# Shihezi, Changji, Yanqi, Heshuo, Tuokexun, Tulufan, Shanshan, Hami,
# Fukang, Kuitun, Kumukuli, Miquan, Qitai, and Turfan.
#
# Kunlun Time UT +05:30
# This region is now in the same status as Xin-zang Time (see above).
# West Tibet, including Pulan, Aheqi, Shufu, Shule;
# West Xinjiang, including Aksu, Atushi, Yining, Hetian, Cele, Luopu, Nileke,
# Zhaosu, Tekesi, Gongliu, Chabuchaer, Huocheng, Bole, Pishan, Suiding,
# and Yarkand.

# From Luther Ma (2009-10-17):
# Almost all (>99.9%) ethnic Chinese (properly ethnic Han) living in
# Xinjiang use Chinese Standard Time. Some are aware of Xinjiang time,
# but have no need of it. All planes, trains, and schools function on
# what is called "Beijing time." When Han make an appointment in Chinese
# they implicitly use Beijing time.
#
# On the other hand, ethnic Uyghurs, who make up about half the
# population of Xinjiang, typically use "Xinjiang time" which is two
# hours behind Beijing time, or UT +06. The government of the Xinjiang
# Uyghur Autonomous Region, (XAUR, or just Xinjiang for short) as well as
# local governments such as the Ürümqi city government use both times in
# publications, referring to what is popularly called Xinjiang time as
# "Ürümqi time." When Uyghurs make an appointment in the Uyghur language
# they almost invariably use Xinjiang time.
#
# (Their ethnic Han compatriots would typically have no clue of its
# widespread use, however, because so extremely few of them are fluent in
# Uyghur, comparable to the number of Anglo-Americans fluent in Navajo.)
#
# (...As with the rest of China there was a brief interval ending in 1990
# or 1991 when summer time was in use.  The confusion was severe, with
# the province not having dual times but four times in use at the same
# time. Some areas remained on standard Xinjiang time or Beijing time and
# others moving their clocks ahead.)

# From Luther Ma (2009-11-19):
# With the risk of being redundant to previous answers these are the most common
# English "transliterations" (w/o using non-English symbols):
#
# 1. Wulumuqi...
# 2. Kashi...
# 3. Urumqi...
# 4. Kashgar...
# ...
# 5. It seems that Uyghurs in Ürümqi has been using Xinjiang since at least the
# 1960's. I know of one Han, now over 50, who grew up in the surrounding
# countryside and used Xinjiang time as a child.
#
# 6. Likewise for Kashgar and the rest of south Xinjiang I don't know of any
# start date for Xinjiang time.
#
# Without having access to local historical records, nor the ability to legally
# publish them, I would go with October 1, 1949, when Xinjiang became the Uyghur
# Autonomous Region under the PRC. (Before that Uyghurs, of course, would also
# not be using Beijing time, but some local time.)

# From David Cochrane (2014-03-26):
# Just a confirmation that Ürümqi time was implemented in Ürümqi on 1 Feb 1986:
# https://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960684,00.html

# From Luther Ma (2014-04-22):
# I have interviewed numerous people of various nationalities and from
# different localities in Xinjiang and can confirm the information in Guo's
# report regarding Xinjiang, as well as the Time article reference by David
# Cochrane.  Whether officially recognized or not (and both are officially
# recognized), two separate times have been in use in Xinjiang since at least
# the Cultural Revolution: Xinjiang Time (XJT), aka Ürümqi Time or local time;
# and Beijing Time.  There is no confusion in Xinjiang as to which name refers
# to which time. Both are widely used in the province, although in some
# population groups might be use one to the exclusion of the other.  The only
# problem is that computers and smart phones list Ürümqi (or Kashgar) as
# having the same time as Beijing.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
# In the early days of the PRC, Tibet was given its own time zone (UT +06)
# but this was withdrawn in 1959 and never reinstated; see Tubten Khétsun,
# Memories of life in Lhasa under Chinese Rule, Columbia U Press, ISBN
# 978-0231142861 (2008), translator's introduction by Matthew Akester, p x.
# As this is before our 1970 cutoff, Tibet doesn't need a separate zone.
#
# Xinjiang Time is well-documented as being officially recognized.  E.g., see
# "The Working-Calendar for The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Government"
# <http://www.sinkiang.gov.cn/service/ourworking/> (2014-04-22).
# Unfortunately, we have no good records of time in Xinjiang before 1986.
# During the 20th century parts of Xinjiang were ruled by the Qing dynasty,
# the Republic of China, various warlords, the First and Second East Turkestan
# Republics, the Soviet Union, the Kuomintang, and the People's Republic of
# China, and tracking down all these organizations' timekeeping rules would be
# quite a trick.  Approximate this lost history by a transition from LMT to
# UT +06 at the start of 1928, the year of accession of the warlord Jin Shuren,
# which happens to be the date given by Shanks & Pottenger (no doubt as a
# guess) as the transition from LMT.  Ignore the usage of +08 before
# 1986-02-01 under the theory that the transition date to +08 is unknown and
# that the sort of users who prefer Asia/Urumqi now typically ignored the
# +08 mandate back then.

# Taiwan

# From smallufo (2010-04-03):
# According to Taiwan's CWB [Central Weather Bureau],
# http://www.cwb.gov.tw/V6/astronomy/cdata/summert.htm
# Taipei has DST in 1979 between July 1st and Sep 30.

# From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2013-07-12):
# On Dec 28, 1895, the Meiji Emperor announced Ordinance No. 167 of
# Meiji Year 28 "The clause about standard time", mentioned that
# Taiwan and Penghu Islands, as well as Yaeyama and Miyako Islands
# (both in Okinawa) adopt the Western Standard Time which is based on
# 120E. The adoption began from Jan 1, 1896. The original text can be
# found on Wikisource:
# https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/標準時ニ關スル件_(公布時)
# ... This could be the first adoption of time zone in Taiwan, because
# during the Qing Dynasty, it seems that there was no time zone
# declared officially.
#
# Later, in the beginning of World War II, on Sep 25, 1937, the Showa
# Emperor announced Ordinance No. 529 of Showa Year 12 "The clause of
# revision in the ordinance No. 167 of Meiji year 28 about standard
# time", in which abolished the adoption of Western Standard Time in
# western islands (listed above), which means the whole Japan
# territory, including later occupations, adopt Japan Central Time
# (UT+9). The adoption began on Oct 1, 1937. The original text can
# be found on Wikisource:
# https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/明治二十八年勅令第百六十七號標準時ニ關スル件中改正ノ件
#
# That is, the time zone of Taipei switched to UT+9 on Oct 1, 1937.

# From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-02):
# I've found more evidence about when the time zone was switched from UT+9
# back to UT+8 after WW2.  I believe it was on Sep 21, 1945.  In a document
# during Japanese era [1] in which the officer told the staff to change time
# zone back to Western Standard Time (UT+8) on Sep 21.  And in another
# history page of National Cheng Kung University [2], on Sep 21 there is a
# note "from today, switch back to Western Standard Time".  From these two
# materials, I believe that the time zone change happened on Sep 21.  And
# today I have found another monthly journal called "The Astronomical Herald"
# from The Astronomical Society of Japan [3] in which it mentioned the fact
# that:
#
# 1. Standard Time of the Country (Japan) was adopted on Jan 1, 1888, using
# the time at 135E (GMT+9)
#
# 2. Standard Time of the Country was renamed to Central Standard Time, on Jan
# 1, 1898, and on the same day, the new territories Taiwan and Penghu islands,
# as well as Yaeyama and Miyako islands, adopted a new time zone called
# Western Standard Time, which is in GMT+8.
#
# 3. Western Standard Time was deprecated on Sep 30, 1937. From then all the
# territories of Japan adopted the same time zone, which is Central Standard
# Time.

# Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-03):
# I finally have found the real official gazette about changing back to
# Western Standard Time on Sep 21 in Taiwan.  It's Taiwan Governor-General
# Bulletin No. 386 in Showa 20 years (1945), published on Sep 19, 1945. [1] ...
# [It] abolishes Bulletin No. 207 in Showa 12 years (1937), which is a local
# bulletin in Taiwan for that Ordinance No. 529. It also mentioned that 1am on
# Sep 21, 1945 will be 12am on Sep 21.  I think this bulletin is much more
# official than the one I mentioned in my first mail, because it's from the
# top-level government in Taiwan. If you're going to quote any resource, this
# would be a good one.
# [1] Taiwan Governor-General Gazette, No. 1018, Sep 19, 1945:
# http://db2.th.gov.tw/db2/view/viewImg.php?imgcode=0072031018a&num=19&bgn=019&end=019&otherImg=&type=gener

# From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-02):
# In 1946, DST in Taiwan was from May 15 and ended on Sep 30. The info from
# Central Weather Bureau website was not correct.
#
# Original Bulletin:
# http://subtpg.tpg.gov.tw/og/image2.asp?f=03502F0AKM1AF
# http://subtpg.tpg.gov.tw/og/image2.asp?f=0350300AKM1B0 (cont.)
#
# In 1947, DST in Taiwan was expanded to Oct 31. There is a backup of that
# telegram announcement from Taiwan Province Government:
#
# http://subtpg.tpg.gov.tw/og/image2.asp?f=0360310AKZ431
#
# Here is a brief translation:
#
#   The Summer Time this year is adopted from midnight Apr 15 until Sep 20
#   midnight. To save (energy?) consumption, we're expanding Summer Time
#   adoption till Oct 31 midnight.
#
# The Central Weather Bureau website didn't mention that, however it can
# be found from historical government announcement database.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-03):
# As per Yu-Cheng Chuang, say that Taiwan was at UT +09 from 1937-10-01
# until 1945-09-21 at 01:00, overriding Shanks & Pottenger.
# Likewise, use Yu-Cheng Chuang's data for DST in Taiwan.

# Macau (Macao, Aomen)
#
# From P Chan (2018-05-10):
# * LegisMac
#   http://legismac.safp.gov.mo/legismac/descqry/Descqry.jsf?lang=pt
#   A database for searching titles of legal documents of Macau in
#   Chinese and Portuguese.  The term "HORÁRIO DE VERÃO" can be used for
#   searching decrees about summer time.
# * Archives of Macao
#   http://www.archives.gov.mo/en/bo/
#   It contains images of old official gazettes.
# * The Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau have a page listing the
#   summer time history.  But it is not complete and has some mistakes.
#   http://www.smg.gov.mo/smg/geophysics/e_t_Summer%20Time.htm
# Macau adopted GMT+8 on 30 Oct 1904 to follow Hong Kong.  Clocks were
# advanced by 25 minutes and 50 seconds.  Which means the LMT used was
# +7:34:10.  As stated in the "Portaria No. 204" dated 21 October 1904
# and published in the Official Gazette on 29 October 1904.
# http://igallery.icm.gov.mo/Images/Archives/BO/MO_AH_PUB_BO_1904_10/MO_AH_PUB_BO_1904_10_00025_Grey.JPG

# Georgia
# From Paul Eggert (1994-11-19):
# Today's _Economist_ (p 60) reports that Georgia moved its clocks forward
# an hour recently, due to a law proposed by Zurab Murvanidze,
# an MP who went on a hunger strike for 11 days to force discussion about it!
# We have no details, but we'll guess they didn't move the clocks back in fall.
#
# From Mathew Englander, quoting AP (1996-10-23 13:05-04):
# Instead of putting back clocks at the end of October, Georgia
# will stay on daylight savings time this winter to save energy,
# President Eduard Shevardnadze decreed Wednesday.
#
# From the BBC via Joseph S. Myers (2004-06-27):
#
# Georgia moved closer to Western Europe on Sunday...  The former Soviet
# republic has changed its time zone back to that of Moscow.  As a result it
# is now just four hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time, rather than five hours
# ahead.  The switch was decreed by the pro-Western president of Georgia,
# Mikheil Saakashvili, who said the change was partly prompted by the process
# of integration into Europe.

# From Teimuraz Abashidze (2005-11-07):
# Government of Georgia ... decided to NOT CHANGE daylight savings time on
# [Oct.] 30, as it was done before during last more than 10 years.
# Currently, we are in fact GMT +4:00, as before 30 October it was GMT
# +3:00.... The problem is, there is NO FORMAL LAW or governmental document
# about it.  As far as I can find, I was told, that there is no document,
# because we just DIDN'T ISSUE document about switching to winter time....
# I don't know what can be done, especially knowing that some years ago our
# DST rules where changed THREE TIMES during one month.

# Milne 1899 says Tbilisi (Tiflis) time was 2:59:05.7.
# Byalokoz 1919 says Georgia was 2:59:11.

# East Timor

# From Tim Parenti (2024-07-01):
# The 1912-01-01 transition occurred at 00:00 new time, per the 1911-05-24
# Portuguese decree (see Europe/Lisbon).  A provision in article 5(c) of the
# decree prescribed that Timor "will keep counting time in harmony with
# neighboring foreign colonies, [for] as long as they do not adopt the time
# that belongs to them in [the Washington Convention] system."

# See Indonesia for the 1945 transition.

# From João Carrascalão, brother of the former governor of East Timor, in
# East Timor may be late for its millennium
# <https://etan.org/et99c/december/26-31/30ETMAY.htm> (1999-12-26/31):
# Portugal tried to change the time forward in 1974 because the sun
# rises too early but the suggestion raised a lot of problems with the
# Timorese and I still don't think it would work today because it
# conflicts with their way of life.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-12-04):
# We don't have any record of the above attempt.
# Most likely our records are incomplete, but we have no better data.

# From Manoel de Almeida e Silva, Deputy Spokesman for the UN Secretary-General
# http://www.hri.org/news/world/undh/2000/00-08-16.undh.html
# (2000-08-16):
# The Cabinet of the East Timor Transition Administration decided
# today to advance East Timor's time by one hour.  The time change,
# which will be permanent, with no seasonal adjustment, will happen at
# midnight on Saturday, September 16.

# India

# British astronomer Henry Park Hollis disliked India Standard Time's offset:
# "A new time system has been proposed for India, Further India, and Burmah.
# The scheme suggested is that the times of the meridians 5½ and 6½ hours
# east of Greenwich should be adopted in these territories.  No reason is
# given why hourly meridians five hours and six hours east should not be
# chosen; a plan which would bring the time of India into harmony with
# that of almost the whole of the civilised world."

# (2015-12-22):
# In January 1906, several thousand cotton-mill workers rioted on the

# From Paul Eggert (2017-04-20):
# Good luck trying to nail down old timekeeping records in India.
# "... in the nineteenth century ... Madras Observatory took its magnetic
# measurements on Göttingen time, its meteorological measurements on Madras
# (local) time, dropped its time ball on Greenwich (ocean navigator's) time,
# and distributed civil (local time)." -- Bartky IR. Selling the true time:
# 19th-century timekeeping in america. Stanford U Press (2000), 247 note 19.
# "A more potent cause of resistance to the general adoption of the present
# standard time lies in the fact that it is Madras time.  The citizen of
# Bombay, proud of being 'primus in Indis' and of Calcutta, equally proud of
# his city being the Capital of India, and - for a part of the year - the Seat
# of the Supreme Government, alike look down on Madras, and refuse to change
# the time they are using, for that of what they regard as a benighted
# Presidency; while Madras, having for long given the standard time to the
# rest of India, would resist the adoption of any other Indian standard in its
# place." -- Oldham RD. On Time in India: a suggestion for its improvement.
# Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (April 1899), 49-55.
#
# "In 1870 ... Madras time - 'now used by the telegraph and regulated from the
# only government observatory' - was suggested as a standard railway time,
# first to be adopted on the Great Indian Peninsular Railway (GIPR)....
# Calcutta, Bombay, and Karachi, were to be allowed to continue with their

# This lists +052110 as Madras local time used in railways, and says that on

# municipalities retained their former time, and the time in Calcutta
# continued to depend on whether you were at the railway station or at
# government offices.  Government time was at +055320 (according to Shanks) or
# at +0554 (according to the Indian Year Book).  Railway time is more
# appropriate for our purposes, as it was better documented, it is what we do
# elsewhere (e.g., Europe/London before 1880), and after 1906 it was
# consistent in the region now identified by Asia/Kolkata.  So, use railway
# time for 1870-1941.  Shanks is our only (and dubious) source for the

# Iran

# From Roozbeh Pournader (2022-05-30):
# Here's an order from the Cabinet to the rest of the government to switch to
# Tehran time, which is mentioned to be already at +03:30:
# https://qavanin.ir/Law/TreeText/180138
# Just in case that goes away, I also saved a copy at archive.org:
# https://web.archive.org/web/20220530111940/https://qavanin.ir/Law/TreeText/180138
# Here's my translation:
#
# "Circular on Matching the Hours of Governmental and Official Circles
# in Provinces
# Approved 1314/03/22 [=1935-06-13]
# According to the ruling of the Honorable Cabinet, it is ordered that from
# now on in all internal provinces of the country, governmental and official
# circles set their time to match Tehran time (three hours and half before
# Greenwich)....
#
# I still haven't found out when Tehran itself switched to +03:30....
#
# From Paul Eggert (2022-06-05):
# Although the above says Tehran was at +03:30 before 1935-06-13, we don't
# know when it switched to +03:30.  For now, use 1935-06-13 as the switch date.
# Although most likely wrong, we have no better info.

# From Roozbeh Pournader (2022-06-01):
# This is from Kayhan newspaper, one of the major Iranian newspapers, from
# March 20, 1978, page 2:
#
# "Pull the clocks 60 minutes forward
# As we informed before, from the fourth day of the month Farvardin of the
# new year [=1978-03-24], clocks will be pulled forward, and people's daily
# work and life program will start one hour earlier than the current program.
# On the 1st day of the month Farvardin of this year [=1977-03-21], they had
# pulled the clocks forward by one hour, but in the month of Mehr
# [=1977-09-23], the clocks were pulled back by 30 minutes.
# In this way, from the 4th day of the month Farvardin, clocks will be ahead
# of the previous years by one hour and a half.
# According to the new program, during the night of 4th of Farvardin, when
# the midnight, meaning 24 o'clock is announced, the hands of the clock must
# be pulled forward by one hour and thus consider midnight 1 o'clock in the
# forenoon."
#
# This implies that in September 1977, when the daylight savings time was
# done with, Iran didn't go back to +03:30, but immediately to +04:00.
#
#
# This is from the major Iranian newspaper Ettela'at, dated [1978-08-03]...,
# page 32. It looks like they decided to get the clocks back to +4:00
# just in time for Ramadan that year:
#
# "Tomorrow Night, Pull the Clocks Back by One Hour
# At 1 o'clock in the forenoon of Saturday 14 Mordad [=1978-08-05], the
# clocks will be pulled one hour back and instead of 1 o'clock in the
# forenoon, Radio Iran will announce 24 o'clock.
# This decision was made in the Cabinet of Ministers meeting of 25 Tir
# [=1978-07-16], [...]
# At the beginning of the year 2537 [=March 1978: Iran was using a different
# year number for a few years then, based on the Coronation of Cyrus the
# Great], the country's official time was pulled forward by one hour and now
# the official time is one hour and a half ahead compared to last year,
# because in Farvardin of last year [=March 1977], the official time was
# pulled forward one hour and this continued until the second half of last
# year [=September 1977] until in the second half of last year the official
# time was pulled back half an hour and that half hour still remains."
#
# This matches the time of the true noon published in the newspapers, as they
# clearly go from +05:00 to +04:00 after that date (which happened during a
# long weekend in Iran).

# From Roozbeh Pournader (2022-05-31):
# [Movahedi S. Cultural preconceptions of time: Can we use operational time
# to meddle in God's Time? Comp Stud Soc Hist. 1985;27(3):385-400]
# https://www.jstor.org/stable/178704
# Here's the quotes from the paper:
# 1. '"Iran's official time keeper moved the clock one hour forward as from
# March 22, 1977 (Farvardin 2, 2536) to make maximum use of daylight and save
# in energy consumption. Thus Iran joined such other countries as Britain in
# observing what is known as 'daylight saving.' The proposal was originally
# put forward by the Ministry of Energy, in no way having any influence on
# observing religious ceremonies. Moving time one hour forward in summer
# means that at 11:00 o'clock on March 21, the official time was set as
# midnight March 22. Then September 24 will actually begin one hour later
# than the end of September 23 [...]." Iran's time base thus continued to be
# Greenwich Mean Time plus three and one-half hours (plus four and one-half
# hours in summer).'
#
# The article sources this from Iran Almanac and Book of Facts, 1977, Tehran:
# Echo of Iran, which is on Google Books at
# https://www.google.com/books/edition/Iran_Almanac_and_Book_of_Facts/9ybVAAAAMAAJ.
# (I confirmed it by searching for snippets.)
#
# 2. "After the fall of the shah, the revolutionary government returned to
# daylight-saving time (DST) on 26 May 1979."
#
# This seems to have been announced just one day in advance, on 25 May 1979.
#
# The change in 1977 clearly seems to be the first daylight savings effort in
# Iran. But the article doesn't mention what happened in 1978 (which was
# still during the shah's government), or how things continued in 1979
# onwards (which was during the Islamic Republic).

# From Francis Santoni (2022-06-01):
# for Iran and 1977 the effective change is only 20 October
# (UIT No. 143 17.XI.1977) and not 23 September (UIT No. 141 13.IX.1977).
# UIT is the Operational Bulletin of International Telecommunication Union.

# From Roozbeh Pournader (2025-03-18):
# ... the exact time of Iran's transition from +0400 to +0330 ... was Friday
# 1357/8/19 AP=1978-11-10. Here's a newspaper clip from the Ettela'at
# newspaper, dated 1357/8/14 AP=1978-11-05, translated from Persian
# (at https://w.wiki/DUEY):
#	Following the government's decision about returning the official time
#	to the previous status, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Energy
#	announced today: At the hour 24 of Friday 19th of Aban (=1978-11-10),
#	the country's time will be pulled back half an hour.
#
# From Roozbeh Pournader (2003-03-15):
# This is an English translation of what I just found (originally in Persian).
# The Gregorian dates in brackets are mine:
#
#	Official Newspaper No. 13548-1370/6/25 [1991-09-16]
#	No. 16760/T233 H				1370/6/10 [1991-09-01]
#
#	The Rule About Change of the Official Time of the Country
#
#	The Board of Ministers, in the meeting dated 1370/5/23 [1991-08-14],
#	based on the suggestion number 2221/D dated 1370/4/22 [1991-07-13]
#	of the Country's Organization for Official and Employment Affairs,
#	and referring to the law for equating the working hours of workers
#	and officers in the whole country dated 1359/4/23 [1980-07-14], and
#	for synchronizing the official times of the country, agreed that:
#
#	The official time of the country will should move forward one hour
#	at the 24[:00] hours of the first day of Farvardin and should return
#	to its previous state at the 24[:00] hours of the 30th day of
#	Shahrivar.
#
#	First Deputy to the President - Hassan Habibi
#
# From personal experience, that agrees with what has been followed
# for at least the last 5 years.  Before that, for a few years, the
# date used was the first Thursday night of Farvardin and the last
# Thursday night of Shahrivar, but I can't give exact dates....
#
# From Roozbeh Pournader (2005-04-05):
# The text of the Iranian law, in effect since 1925, clearly mentions
# that the true solar year is the measure, and there is no arithmetic
# leap year calculation involved.  There has never been any serious
# plan to change that law....
#
# From Paul Eggert (2022-06-30):
# Go with Pournader for 1935 through spring 1979, and for timestamps
# after August 1991; go with with Shanks & Pottenger for other timestamps.
# Go with Santoni's citation of the UIT for fall 1977, as 20 October 1977
# is 28 Mehr 1356, consistent with the "Mehr" in Pournader's source.
# Assume that the UIT's "1930" is UTC, i.e., 24:00 local time.

# discrepancies between cal-persia and the Iranian calendar:
# For 2091 solar-longitude-after yields 2091-03-20 08:40:07.7 UT for
# the vernal equinox and that gets so close to 12:00 some local
# Iranian time that the definition of the correct location needs to be
# known exactly, amongst other factors.  2157 is even closer:
# 2157-03-20 08:37:15.5 UT.  But the Gregorian year 2025 should give
# no interpretation problem whatsoever.  By the way, another instant
# in the near future where there will be a discrepancy between
# arithmetical and astronomical Iranian calendars will be in 2058:
# vernal equinox on 2058-03-20 09:03:05.9 UT.  The Java version of
# Reingold's/Dershowitz' calculator gives correctly the Gregorian date
# 2058-03-21 for 1 Farvardin 1437 (astronomical).
#
# From Steffen Thorsen (2006-03-22):
# Several of my users have reported that Iran will not observe DST anymore:

#
# From Reuters (2007-09-16), with a heads-up from Jesper Nørgaard Welen:
# ... the Guardian Council ... approved a law on Sunday to re-introduce
# daylight saving time ...
# https://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKBLA65048420070916
#
# From Roozbeh Pournader (2007-11-05):
# This is quoted from Official Gazette of the Islamic Republic of
# Iran, Volume 63, No. 18242, dated Tuesday 1386/6/24
# [2007-10-16]. I am doing the best translation I can:...
# The official time of the country will be moved forward for one hour
# on the 24 hours of the first day of the month of Farvardin and will
# be changed back to its previous state on the 24 hours of the
# thirtieth day of Shahrivar.
#
# From Ali Mirjamali (2022-05-10):
# Official IR News Agency announcement: irna.ir/xjJ3TT
# ...
# Highlights: DST will be cancelled for the next Iranian year 1402
# (i.e 2023-March-21) and forthcoming years.

# Iraq
#
# From Jonathan Lennox (2000-06-12):
# An article in this week's Economist ("Inside the Saddam-free zone", p. 50 in
# the U.S. edition) on the Iraqi Kurds contains a paragraph:
# "The three northern provinces ... switched their clocks this spring and
# are an hour ahead of Baghdad."
#
# But Rives McDow (2000-06-18) quotes a contact in Iraqi-Kurdistan as follows:
# In the past, some Kurdish nationalists, as a protest to the Iraqi
# Government, did not adhere to daylight saving time.  They referred
# to daylight saving as Saddam time.  But, as of today, the time zone
# in Iraqi-Kurdistan is on standard time with Baghdad, Iraq.
#
# So we'll ignore the Economist's claim.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-03-10):
# The cabinet in Iraq abolished DST last week, according to the following
# news sources (in Arabic):
# http://www.aljeeran.net/wesima_articles/news-20080305-98602.html

# Israel

# For more info about the motivation for DST in Israel, see:
# Barak Y. Israel's Daylight Saving Time controversy. Israel Affairs.
# 2020-08-11. https://doi.org/10.1080/13537121.2020.1806564

# From Ephraim Silverberg (2001-01-11):
#
# I coined "IST/IDT" circa 1988.  Until then there were three
# different abbreviations in use:
#
# JST  Jerusalem Standard Time [Danny Braniss, Hebrew University]
# IZT  Israel Zonal (sic) Time [Prof. Haim Papo, Technion]
# EEST Eastern Europe Standard Time [used by almost everyone else]
#
# Since timezones should be called by country and not capital cities,
# I ruled out JST.  As Israel is in Asia Minor and not Eastern Europe,
# EEST was equally unacceptable.  Since "zonal" was not compatible with
# any other timezone abbreviation, I felt that 'IST' was the way to go
# and, indeed, it has received almost universal acceptance in timezone
# settings in Israeli computers.
#
# In any case, I am happy to share timezone abbreviations with India,
# high on my favorite-country list (and not only because my wife's
# family is from India).

# From Paul Eggert (2020-10-27):
# Several of the midnight transitions mentioned above are ambiguous;
# are they 00:00, 00:00s, 24:00, or 24:00s?  When resolving these ambiguities,
# try to minimize changes from previous tzdb versions, for lack of better info.
# Commentary from previous versions is included below, to help explain this.

# From Ephraim Silverberg
# (1997-03-04, 1998-03-16, 1998-12-28, 2000-01-17, 2000-07-25, 2004-12-22,
# and 2005-02-17):

# According to the Office of the Secretary General of the Ministry of
# Interior, there is NO set rule for Daylight-Savings/Standard time changes.
# One thing is entrenched in law, however: that there must be at least 150
# days of daylight savings time annually.  From 1993-1998, the change to
# daylight savings time was on a Friday morning from midnight IST to
# 1 a.m IDT; up until 1998, the change back to standard time was on a
# Saturday night from midnight daylight savings time to 11 p.m. standard
# time.  1996 is an exception to this rule where the change back to standard
# time took place on Sunday night instead of Saturday night to avoid
# conflicts with the Jewish New Year.  In 1999, the change to
# daylight savings time was still on a Friday morning but from
# 2 a.m. IST to 3 a.m. IDT; furthermore, the change back to standard time
# was also on a Friday morning from 2 a.m. IDT to 1 a.m. IST for
# 1999 only.  In the year 2000, the change to daylight savings time was
# similar to 1999, but although the change back will be on a Friday, it
# will take place from 1 a.m. IDT to midnight IST.  Starting in 2001, all
# changes to/from will take place at 1 a.m. old time, but now there is no
# rule as to what day of the week it will take place in as the start date
# (except in 2003) is the night after the Passover Seder (i.e. the eve
# of the 16th of Nisan in the lunar Hebrew calendar) and the end date
# (except in 2002) is three nights before Yom Kippur [Day of Atonement]
# (the eve of the 7th of Tishrei in the lunar Hebrew calendar).

# Japan

# '9:00' and 'JST' is from Guy Harris.

# From Paul Eggert (2020-01-19):
# Starting in the 7th century, Japan generally followed an ancient Chinese
# timekeeping system that divided night and day into six hours each,
# with hour length depending on season.  In 1873 the government
# started requiring the use of a Western style 24-hour clock.  See:
# Yulia Frumer, "Making Time: Astronomical Time Measurement in Tokugawa Japan"
# <https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1043907065>.  As the tzdb code and
# data support only 24-hour clocks, its tables model timestamps before
# 1873 using Western-style local mean time.

# From Hideyuki Suzuki (1998-11-09):
# 'Tokyo' usually stands for the former location of Tokyo Astronomical
# Observatory: 139° 44' 40.90" E (9h 18m 58.727s), 35° 39' 16.0" N.
# This data is from 'Rika Nenpyou (Chronological Scientific Tables) 1996'
# edited by National Astronomical Observatory of Japan....
# JST (Japan Standard Time) has been used since 1888-01-01 00:00 (JST).
# The law is enacted on 1886-07-07.

# From Hideyuki Suzuki (1998-11-16):
# The ordinance No. 51 (1886) established "standard time" in Japan,
# which stands for the time on 135° E.
# In the ordinance No. 167 (1895), "standard time" was renamed to "central
# standard time".  And the same ordinance also established "western standard
# time", which stands for the time on 120° E....  But "western standard
# time" was abolished in the ordinance No. 529 (1937).  In the ordinance No.
# 167, there is no mention regarding for what place western standard time is
# standard....
#
# I wrote "ordinance" above, but I don't know how to translate.
# In Japanese it's "chokurei", which means ordinance from emperor.

# From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2013-07-12):
# ...the Meiji Emperor announced Ordinance No. 167 of Meiji Year 28 "The clause
# about standard time" ... The adoption began from Jan 1, 1896.
# https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/標準時ニ關スル件_(公布時)
#
# ...the Showa Emperor announced Ordinance No. 529 of Showa Year 12 ... which
# means the whole Japan territory, including later occupations, adopt Japan
# Central Time (UT+9). The adoption began on Oct 1, 1937.
# https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/明治二十八年勅令第百六十七號標準時ニ關スル件中改正ノ件

# From Paul Eggert (1995-03-06):
# Today's _Asahi Evening News_ (page 4) reports that Japan had
# daylight saving between 1948 and 1951, but "the system was discontinued
# because the public believed it would lead to longer working hours."

# From Mayumi Negishi in the 2005-08-10 Japan Times:
# http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20050810f2.htm
# Occupation authorities imposed daylight-saving time on Japan on
# [1948-05-01]....  But lack of prior debate and the execution of
# daylight-saving time just three days after the bill was passed generated
# deep hatred of the concept....  The Diet unceremoniously passed a bill to
# dump the unpopular system in October 1951, less than a month after the San
# Francisco Peace Treaty was signed.  (A government poll in 1951 showed 53%
# of the Japanese wanted to scrap daylight-saving time, as opposed to 30% who
# wanted to keep it.)

# From Takayuki Nikai (2018-01-19):
# The source of information is Japanese law.
# http://www.shugiin.go.jp/internet/itdb_housei.nsf/html/houritsu/00219480428029.htm
# http://www.shugiin.go.jp/internet/itdb_housei.nsf/html/houritsu/00719500331039.htm
# ... In summary, it is written as follows.  From 24:00 on the first Saturday
# in May, until 0:00 on the day after the second Saturday in September.

# From Phake Nick (2018-09-27):
# [T]he webpage authored by National Astronomical Observatory of Japan
# https://eco.mtk.nao.ac.jp/koyomi/wiki/BBFEB9EF2FB2C6BBFEB9EF.html
# ... mentioned that using Showa 23 (year 1948) as example, 13pm of September
# 11 in summer time will equal to 0am of September 12 in standard time.
# It cited a document issued by the Liaison Office which briefly existed
# during the postwar period of Japan, where the detail on implementation
# of the summer time is described in the document.
# https://eco.mtk.nao.ac.jp/koyomi/wiki/BBFEB9EF2FB2C6BBFEB9EFB2C6BBFEB9EFA4CEBCC2BBDCA4CBA4C4A4A4A4C6.pdf
# The text in the document do instruct a fall back to occur at
# September 11, 13pm in summer time, while ordinary citizens can
# change the clock before they sleep.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-09-27):
# This instruction is equivalent to "Sat>=8 25:00", so use that.  zic treats
# it like "Sun>=9 01:00", which is not quite the same but is the best we can
# do in any POSIX or C platform.  The "25:00" assumes zic from 2007 or later,
# which should be safe now.

# From Paul Eggert (2013-12-11):

# From Steffen Thorsen (2021-09-24):

# Kazakhstan

# From Kazakhstan Embassy's News Bulletin No. 11
# <http://www.kazsociety.org.uk/news/2005/03/30.htm> (2005-03-21):
# The Government of Kazakhstan passed a resolution March 15 abolishing
# daylight saving time citing lack of economic benefits and health
# complications coupled with a decrease in productivity.
#
# From Branislav Kojic (in Astana) via Gwillim Law (2005-06-28):
# ... what happened was that the former Kazakhstan Eastern time zone
# was "blended" with the Central zone.  Therefore, Kazakhstan now has
# two time zones, and difference between them is one hour.  The zone
# closer to UTC is the former Western zone (probably still called the
# same), encompassing four provinces in the west: Aqtöbe, Atyraū,
# Mangghystaū, and West Kazakhstan.  The other zone encompasses
# everything else....  I guess that would make Kazakhstan time zones
# de jure UTC+5 and UTC+6 respectively.

# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-03-27):
# Review of the linked documents from http://adilet.zan.kz/
# produced the following data for post-1991 Kazakhstan:
#
# 0. Act of the Cabinet of Ministers of the USSR
# from 1991-02-04 No. 20
# http://pravo.gov.ru/proxy/ips/?docbody=&nd=102010545
# removed the extra hour ("decree time") on the territory of the USSR
# starting with the last Sunday of March 1991.
# It also allowed (but not mandated) Kazakh SSR, Kirghiz SSR, Tajik SSR,
# Turkmen SSR and Uzbek SSR to not have "summer" time.
#
# The 1992-01-13 act also refers to the act of the Cabinet of Ministers
# of the Kazakh SSR from 1991-03-20 No. 170 "About the act of the Cabinet
# of Ministers of the USSR from 1991-02-04 No. 20" but I didn't found its
# text.
#
# According to Izvestia newspaper No. 68 (23334) from 1991-03-20
# -- page 6; available at http://libinfo.org/newsr/newsr2574.djvu via
# http://libinfo.org/index.php?id=58564 -- on 1991-03-31 at 2:00 during
# transition to "summer" time:
# Republic of Georgia, Latvian SSR, Lithuanian SSR, SSR Moldova,
# Estonian SSR; Komi ASSR; Kaliningrad oblast; Nenets autonomous okrug
# were to move clocks 1 hour forward.
# Kazakh SSR (excluding Uralsk oblast); Republic of Kyrgyzstan, Tajik
# SSR; Andijan, Jizzakh, Namangan, Sirdarya, Tashkent, Fergana oblasts
# of the Uzbek SSR were to move clocks 1 hour backwards.
# Other territories were to not move clocks.
# When the "summer" time would end on 1991-09-29, clocks were to be
# moved 1 hour backwards on the territory of the USSR excluding
# Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Uzbekistan, Turkmenia, Tajikistan.
#
# Apparently there were last minute changes. Apparently Kazakh act No. 170
# was one of such changes.
#
# https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Декретное_время
# claims that Sovetskaya Rossiya newspaper on 1991-03-29 published that
# Nenets autonomous okrug, Komi and Kazakhstan (excluding Uralsk oblast)
# were to not move clocks and Uralsk oblast was to move clocks
# forward; on 1991-09-29 Kazakhstan was to move clocks backwards.
# (Probably there were changes even after that publication. There is an
# article claiming that Kaliningrad oblast decided on 1991-03-29 to not
# move clocks.)
#
# This implies that on 1991-03-31 Asia/Oral remained on +04/+05 while
# the rest of Kazakhstan switched from +06/+07 to +05/06 or from +05/06
# to +04/+05. It's unclear how Qyzylorda oblast moved into the fifth
# time belt. (By switching from +04/+05 to +05/+06 on 1991-09-29?) ...
#
# 1. Act of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 1992-01-13 No. 28
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P920000028_
# (text includes modification from the 1996 act)
# introduced new rules for calculation of time, mirroring Russian
# 1992-01-08 act.  It specified that time would be calculated
# according to time belts plus extra hour ("decree time"), moved clocks
# on the whole territory of Kazakhstan 1 hour forward on 1992-01-19 at
# 2:00, specified DST rules.  It acknowledged that Kazakhstan was
# located in the fourth and the fifth time belts and specified the
# border between them to be located east of Qostanay and Aktyubinsk
# oblasts (notably including Turgai and Qyzylorda oblasts into the fifth
# time belt).
#
# This means switch on 1992-01-19 at 2:00 from +04/+05 to +05/+06 for
# Asia/Aqtau, Asia/Aqtobe, Asia/Oral, Atyraū and Qostanay oblasts; from
# +05/+06 to +06/+07 for Asia/Almaty and Asia/Qyzylorda (and Arkalyk)....
#
# 2. Act of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 1992-03-27 No. 284
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P920000284_
# cancels extra hour ("decree time") for Uralsk and Qyzylorda oblasts
# since the last Sunday of March 1992, while keeping them in the fourth
# and the fifth time belts respectively.
#
# 3. Order of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 1994-09-23 No. 384
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/R940000384_
# cancels the extra hour ("decree time") on the territory of Mangghystaū
# oblast since the last Sunday of September 1994 (saying that time on
# the territory would correspond to the third time belt as a
# result)....
#
# 4. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 1996-05-08 No. 575
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P960000575_
# amends the 1992-01-13 act to end summer time in October instead
# of September, mirroring identical Russian change from 1996-04-23 act.
#
# 5. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 1999-03-26 No. 305
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P990000305_
# cancels the extra hour ("decree time") for Atyraū oblast since the
# last Sunday of March 1999 while retaining the oblast in the fourth
# time belt.
#
# This means change from +05/+06 to +04/+05....
#
# 6. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 2000-11-23 No. 1749
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/archive/docs/P000001749_/23.11.2000
# replaces the previous five documents.
#
# The only changes I noticed are in definition of the border between the
# fourth and the fifth time belts.  They account for changes in spelling
# and administrative division (splitting of Turgai oblast in 1997
# probably changed time in territories incorporated into Qostanay oblast
# (including Arkalyk) from +06/+07 to +05/+06) and move Qyzylorda oblast
# from being in the fifth time belt and not using decree time into the
# fourth time belt (no change in practice).
#
# 7. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 2003-12-29 No. 1342
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P030001342_
# modified the 2000-11-23 act.  No relevant changes, apparently.
#
# 8. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 2004-07-20 No. 775
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/archive/docs/P040000775_/20.07.2004
# modified the 2000-11-23 act to move Qostanay and Qyzylorda oblasts into
# the fifth time belt and add Aktobe oblast to the list of regions not
# using extra hour ("decree time"), leaving Kazakhstan with only 2 time
# zones (+04/+05 and +06/+07).  The changes were to be implemented
# during DST transitions in 2004 and 2005 but the acts got radically
# amended before implementation happened.
#
# 9. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 2004-09-15 No. 1059
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P040001059_
# modified the 2000-11-23 act to remove exceptions from the "decree time"
# (leaving Kazakhstan in +05/+06 and +06/+07 zones), amended the
# 2004-07-20 act to implement changes for Atyraū, West Kazakhstan,
# Qostanay, Qyzylorda and Mangghystaū oblasts by not moving clocks
# during the 2004 transition to "winter" time.
#
# This means transition from +04/+05 to +05/+06 for Atyraū oblast (no
# zone currently), Asia/Oral, Asia/Aqtau and transition from +05/+06 to
# +06/+07 for Qostanay oblast (Qostanay and Arkalyk, no zones currently)
# and Asia/Qyzylorda on 2004-10-31 at 3:00....
#
# 10. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 2005-03-15 No. 231
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P050000231_
# removes DST provisions from the 2000-11-23 act, removes most of the
# (already implemented) provisions from the 2004-07-20 and 2004-09-15
# acts, comes into effect 10 days after official publication.
# The only practical effect seems to be the abolition of the summer
# time.
#
# Unamended version of the act of the Government of the Russian Federation
# No. 23 from 1992-01-08 [See 'europe' file for details].
# Kazakh 1992-01-13 act appears to provide the same rules and 1992-03-27
# act was to be enacted on the last Sunday of March 1992.

# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-11-08):
# Turgai reorganization should affect only southern part of Qostanay
# oblast.  Which should probably be separated into Asia/Arkalyk zone.
# (There were also 1970, 1988 and 1990 Turgai oblast reorganizations
# according to wikipedia.)
#
# [For Qostanay] http://www.ng.kz/gazeta/195/hranit/
# suggests that clocks were to be moved 40 minutes backwards on
# 1920-01-01 to the fourth time belt.  But I do not understand
# how that could happen....
#
# [For Atyrau and Oral] 1919 decree
# (http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_russia-1919-02-08.html
# and in Byalokoz) lists Ural river (plus 10 versts on its left bank) in
# the third time belt (before 1930 this means +03).

# From Alexander Konzurovski (2018-12-20):
# (Asia/Qyzylorda) is changing its time zone from UTC+6 to UTC+5
# effective December 21st, 2018....
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P1800000817 (russian language).

# Korea ran a daylight saving program from 1949-61 but stopped it

# From Sanghyuk Jung (2014-10-29):

# DST in Republic of Korea was as follows....  And I checked old

# Lebanon
#
# From Saadallah Itani (2023-03-23):
# Lebanon ... announced today delay of Spring forward from March 25 to April 20.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2023-03-27):
# This announcement was by the Lebanese caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati.
# https://www.mtv.com.lb/en/News/Local/1352516/lebanon-postpones-daylight-saving-time-adoption
# A video was later leaked to the media of parliament speaker Nabih Berri
# asking Mikati to postpone DST to aid observance of Ramadan, Mikati objecting
# that this would cause problems such as scheduling airline flights, to which
# Berri interjected, "What flights?"
#
# The change was controversial and led to a partly-sectarian divide.
# Many Lebanese institutions, including the education ministry, the Maronite
# church, and two news channels LCBI and MTV, ignored the announcement and
# went ahead with the long-scheduled spring-forward on March 25/26, some
# arguing that the prime minister had not followed the law because the change
# had not been approved by the cabinet.  Google went with the announcement;
# Apple ignored it.  At least one bank followed the announcement for its doors,
# but ignored the announcement in internal computer systems.
# Beirut international airport listed two times for each departure.
# Dan Azzi wrote "My view is that this whole thing is a Dumb and Dumber movie."
# Eventually the prime minister backed down, said the cabinet had decided to
# stick with its 1998 decision, and that DST would begin midnight March 29/30.
# https://www.nna-leb.gov.lb/en/miscellaneous/604093/lebanon-has-two-times-of-day-amid-daylight-savings
# https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/27/lebanon-in-two-different-time-zones-as-government-disagrees-on-daylight-savings.html
#
# Although we could model the chaos with two Zones, that would likely cause
# more trouble than it would cure.  Since so many manual clocks and
# computer-based timestamps ignored the announcement, stick with official
# cabinet resolutions in the data while recording the prime minister's
# announcement as a comment.  This is how we treated a similar situation in
# Rio de Janeiro in spring 1993.

# Mongolia

# Shanks & Pottenger say that Mongolia has three time zones, but
# The USNO (1995-12-21) and the CIA map Standard Time Zones of the World
# (2005-03) both say that it has just one.

# From Oscar van Vlijmen (1999-12-11):
# General Information Mongolia
# <http://www.mongoliatourism.gov.mn/general.htm> (1999-09)
# "Time: Mongolia has two time zones. Three westernmost provinces of
# Bayan-Ölgii, Uvs, and Hovd are one hour earlier than the capital city, and
# the rest of the country follows the Ulaanbaatar time, which is UTC/GMT plus
# eight hours."

# From Rives McDow (1999-12-13):
# Mongolia discontinued the use of daylight savings time in 1999; 1998
# being the last year it was implemented.  The dates of implementation I am
# unsure of, but most probably it was similar to Russia, except for the time
# of implementation may have been different....
# Some maps in the past have indicated that there was an additional time
# zone in the eastern part of Mongolia, including the provinces of Dornod,
# Sükhbaatar, and possibly Khentii.

# From Paul Eggert (1999-12-15):
# Naming and spelling is tricky in Mongolia.
# We'll use Hovd (also spelled Chovd and Khovd) to represent the west zone;
# the capital of the Hovd province is sometimes called Hovd, sometimes Dund-Us,
# and sometimes Jirgalanta (with variant spellings), but the name Hovd
# is good enough for our purposes.

# From Rives McDow (2001-05-13):
# In addition to Mongolia starting daylight savings as reported earlier
# (adopted DST on 2001-04-27 02:00 local time, ending 2001-09-28),
# there are three time zones.
#
# Provinces [at 7:00]: Bayan-Ölgii, Uvs, Khovd, Zavkhan, Govi-Altai
# Provinces [at 8:00]: Khövsgöl, Bulgan, Arkhangai, Khentii, Töv,
#	Bayankhongor, Övörkhangai, Dundgovi, Dornogovi, Ömnögovi
# Provinces [at 9:00]: Dornod, Sükhbaatar
#
# [The province of Selenge is omitted from the above lists.]

# From Ganbold Ts., Ulaanbaatar (2004-04-17):
# Daylight saving occurs at 02:00 local time last Saturday of March.
# It will change back to normal at 02:00 local time last Saturday of
# September.... As I remember this rule was changed in 2001.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2004-04-17):
# For now, assume Rives McDow's informant got confused about Friday vs
# Saturday, and that his 2001 dates should have 1 added to them.

# From Paul Eggert (2005-07-26):
# We have wildly conflicting information about Mongolia's time zones.
# Bill Bonnet (2005-05-19) reports that the US Embassy in Ulaanbaatar says
# there is only one time zone and that DST is observed, citing Microsoft
# Windows XP as the source.  Risto Nykänen (2005-05-16) reports that
# travelmongolia.org says there are two time zones (UT +07, +08) with no DST.
# Oscar van Vlijmen (2005-05-20) reports that the Mongolian Embassy in
# Washington, DC says there are two time zones, with DST observed.
# He also found
# http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/index.php?subaction=showcomments&id=1111634894&archive=&start_from=&ucat=1&
# which also says that there is DST, and which has a comment by "Toddius"
# (2005-03-31 06:05 +0700) saying "Mongolia actually has 3.5 time zones.
# The West (OLGII) is +7 GMT, most of the country is ULAT is +8 GMT
# and some Eastern provinces are +9 GMT but Sükhbaatar Aimag is SUHK +8.5 GMT.
# The SUKH timezone is new this year, it is one of the few things the
# parliament passed during the tumultuous winter session."
# For now, let's ignore this information, until we have more confirmation.

# From Ganbold Ts. (2007-02-26):
# Parliament of Mongolia has just changed the daylight-saving rule in February.
# They decided not to adopt daylight-saving time....
# http://www.mongolnews.mn/index.php?module=unuudur&sec=view&id=15742

# From Deborah Goldsmith (2008-03-30):
# We received a bug report claiming that the tz database UTC offset for
# Asia/Choibalsan (GMT+09:00) is incorrect, and that it should be GMT
# +08:00 instead. Different sources appear to disagree with the tz
# database on this, e.g.:
#
# https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=1026
# http://www.worldtimeserver.com/current_time_in_MN.aspx
#
# both say GMT+08:00.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-03-31):
# eznis airways, which operates several domestic flights, has a flight
# schedule here:
# http://www.eznis.com/Container.jsp?id=112
# (click the English flag for English)
#
# There it appears that flights between Choibalsan and Ulaanbaatar arrive
# about 1:35 - 1:50 hours later in local clock time, no matter the
# direction, while Ulaanbaatar-Khovd takes 2 hours in the Eastern
# direction and 3:35 back, which indicates that Ulaanbaatar and Khovd are
# in different time zones (like we know about), while Choibalsan and
# Ulaanbaatar are in the same time zone (correction needed).

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-05-19):
# Assume that Choibalsan is indeed offset by 8:00.

# From Heitor David Pinto (2024-06-23):
# Sources about time zones in Mongolia seem to list one of two conflicting
# configurations.  The first configuration, mentioned in a comment to the TZ
# database in 1999, citing a Mongolian government website, lists the provinces
# of Bayan-Ölgii, Khovd and Uvs in UTC+7, and the rest of the country in
# UTC+8.  The second configuration, mentioned in a comment to the database in
# 2001, lists Bayan-Ölgii, Khovd, Uvs, Govi-Altai and Zavkhan in UTC+7, Dornod
# and Sükhbaatar in UTC+9, and the rest of the country in UTC+8.
#
# The first configuration is still mentioned by several Mongolian travel
# agencies:
# https://www.adventurerider.mn/en/page/about_mongolia
# http://www.naturetours.mn/nt/mongolia.php
# https://www.newjuulchin.mn/web/content/7506?unique=fa24a0f6e96e022a3578ee5195ac879638c734ce
#
# It also matches these flight schedules in 2013:
# http://web.archive.org/web/20130722023600/https://www.hunnuair.com/en/timetabled
# The flight times imply that the airports of Uliastai (Zavkhan), Choibalsan
# (Dornod) and Altai (Govi-Altai) are in the same time zone as Ulaanbaatar,
# and Khovd is one hour behind....
#
# The second configuration was mentioned by an official of the Mongolian
# standards agency in an interview in 2014: https://ikon.mn/n/9v6
# And it's still listed by the Mongolian aviation agency:
# https://ais.mn/files/aip/eAIP/2023-12-25/html/eSUP/ZM-eSUP-23-04-en-MN.html
#
# ... I believe that the first configuration is what is actually observed in
# Mongolia and has been so all along, at least since 1999.  The second
# configuration closely matches the ideal time zone boundaries at 97.5° E and
# 112.5° E but it doesn't seem to be used in practice.

# From Ganbold Tsagaankhuu (2015-03-10):
# It seems like yesterday Mongolian Government meeting has concluded to use
# daylight saving time in Mongolia....  Starting at 2:00AM of last Saturday of
# March 2015, daylight saving time starts.  And 00:00AM of last Saturday of
# September daylight saving time ends.  Source:

# Pakistan

# From Rives McDow (2002-03-13):
# I have been advised that Pakistan has decided to adopt dst on a
# TRIAL basis for one year, starting 00:01 local time on April 7, 2002
# and ending at 00:01 local time October 6, 2002.  This is what I was
# told, but I believe that the actual time of change may be 00:00; the
# 00:01 was to make it clear which day it was on.

# From Paul Eggert (2002-03-15):
# Jesper Nørgaard found this URL:
# http://www.pak.gov.pk/public/news/app/app06_dec.htm
# (dated 2001-12-06) which says that the Cabinet adopted a scheme "to
# advance the clocks by one hour on the night between the first
# Saturday and Sunday of April and revert to the original position on
# 15th October each year".  This agrees with McDow's 04-07 at 00:00,
# but disagrees about the October transition, and makes it sound like
# it's not on a trial basis.  Also, the "between the first Saturday
# and Sunday of April" phrase, if taken literally, means that the
# transition takes place at 00:00 on the first Sunday on or after 04-02.

# From Paul Eggert (2003-02-09):
# DAWN <http://www.dawn.com/2002/10/06/top13.htm> reported on 2002-10-05
# that 2002 DST ended that day at midnight.  Go with McDow for now.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2003-03-14):
# According to http://www.dawn.com/2003/03/07/top15.htm
# there will be no DST in Pakistan this year:
#
# ISLAMABAD, March 6: Information and Media Development Minister Sheikh
# Rashid Ahmed on Thursday said the cabinet had reversed a previous
# decision to advance clocks by one hour in summer and put them back by
# one hour in winter with the aim of saving light hours and energy.
#
# The minister told a news conference that the experiment had rather
# shown 8 per cent higher consumption of electricity.

# Palestine

# From Amos Shapir (1998-02-15):
#
# From 1917 until 1948-05-15, all of Palestine, including the parts now
# known as the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, was under British rule.
# Therefore the rules given for Israel for that period, apply there too...
#
# The Gaza Strip was under Egyptian rule between 1948-05-15 until 1967-06-05
# (except a short occupation by Israel from 1956-11 till 1957-03, but no
# time zone was affected then).  It was never formally annexed to Egypt,
# though.
#
# The rest of Palestine was under Jordanian rule at that time, formally
# annexed in 1950 as the West Bank (and the word "Trans" was dropped from
# the country's previous name of "the Hashemite Kingdom of the
# Trans-Jordan").  So the rules for Jordan for that time apply.  Major
# towns in that area are Nablus (Shchem), El-Halil (Hebron), Ramallah, and
# East Jerusalem.
#
# Both areas were occupied by Israel in June 1967, but not annexed (except
# for East Jerusalem).  They were on Israel time since then; there might
# have been a Military Governor's order about time zones, but I'm not aware
# of any (such orders may have been issued semi-annually whenever summer
# time was in effect, but maybe the legal aspect of time was just neglected).
#
# The Palestinian Authority was established in 1993, and got hold of most
# towns in the West Bank and Gaza by 1995.  I know that in order to
# demonstrate...independence, they have been switching to
# summer time and back on a different schedule than Israel's, but I don't
# know when this was started, or what algorithm is used (most likely the
# Jordanian one).
#
# To summarize, the table should probably look something like that:
#
# Area \ when | 1918-1947 | 1948-1967 | 1967-1995 | 1996-
# ------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------
# Israel      | Zion      | Zion      | Zion      | Zion
# West bank   | Zion      | Jordan    | Zion      | Jordan
# Gaza        | Zion      | Egypt     | Zion      | Jordan
#
# I guess more info may be available from the PA's web page (if/when they
# have one).

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Shanks & Pottenger write that Gaza did not observe DST until 1957, but go
# with Shapir and assume that it observed DST from 1940 through 1947,
# and that it used Jordanian rules starting in 1996.
# We don't yet need a separate entry for the West Bank, since
# the only differences between it and Gaza that we know about
# occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.
# However, as we get more information, we may need to add entries
# for parts of the West Bank as they transitioned from Israel's rules
# to Palestine's rules.

# From IINS News Service - Israel - 1998-03-23 10:38:07 Israel time,
# forwarded by Ephraim Silverberg:
#
# Despite the fact that Israel changed over to daylight savings time
# last week, the PLO Authority (PA) has decided not to turn its clocks
# one-hour forward at this time.  As a sign of independence from Israeli rule,
# the PA has decided to implement DST in April.

# From Paul Eggert (1999-09-20):
# Daoud Kuttab writes in Holiday havoc
# http://www.jpost.com/com/Archive/22.Apr.1999/Opinion/Article-2.html
# (Jerusalem Post, 1999-04-22) that
# the Palestinian National Authority changed to DST on 1999-04-15.
# I vaguely recall that they switch back in October (sorry, forgot the source).
# For now, let's assume that the spring switch was at 24:00,
# and that they switch at 0:00 on the 3rd Fridays of April and October.

# From Paul Eggert (2005-11-22):
# Starting 2004 transitions are from Steffen Thorsen's web site timeanddate.com.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2005-11-23):
# A user from Gaza reported that Gaza made the change early because of
# the Ramadan.  Next year Ramadan will be even earlier, so I think
# there is a good chance next year's end date will be around two weeks
# earlier - the same goes for Jordan.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2006-08-17):
# I was informed by a user in Bethlehem that in Bethlehem it started the
# same day as Israel, and after checking with other users in the area, I
# was informed that they started DST one day after Israel.  I was not
# able to find any authoritative sources at the time, nor details if
# Gaza changed as well, but presumed Gaza to follow the same rules as
# the West Bank.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2006-09-26):
# according to the Palestine News Network (2006-09-19):
# http://english.pnn.ps/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=596&Itemid=5
# > The Council of Ministers announced that this year its winter schedule
# > will begin early, as of midnight Thursday.  It is also time to turn
# > back the clocks for winter.  Friday will begin an hour late this week.
# I guess it is likely that next year's date will be moved as well,
# because of the Ramadan.

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2007-09-18):
# According to Steffen Thorsen's web site the Gaza Strip and the rest of the
# Palestinian territories left DST early on 13.th. of September at 2:00.

# From Paul Eggert (2007-09-20):
# My understanding is that Gaza and the West Bank disagree even over when
# the weekend is (Thursday+Friday versus Friday+Saturday), so I'd be a bit
# surprised if they agreed about DST.  But for now, assume they agree.
# For lack of better information, predict that future changes will be
# the 2nd Thursday of September at 02:00.

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2008-08-28):
# Here is an article, that Mideast running on different clocks at Ramadan.
#
# Gaza Strip (as Egypt) ended DST at midnight Thursday (Aug 28, 2008), while
# the West Bank will end Daylight Saving Time at midnight Sunday (Aug 31, 2008).

# From Paul Eggert (2024-01-25):
# For now, guess that spring and fall transitions will normally

# to standard time at 02:00 the last Saturday before Ramadan and back
# to DST at 02:00 the second Saturday after Ramadan, and that
# if the normal spring-forward or fall-back transition occurs during
# Ramadan the former is delayed and the latter advanced.
# To implement this, I predicted Ramadan-oriented transition dates for
# 2026 through 2086 by running the following program under GNU Emacs 29.2,
# with the results integrated by hand into the table below.
# Predictions after 2086 are approximated without Ramadan.

# From Paul Eggert (2024-01-21):
# The Spanish initially used American (west-of-Greenwich) time.
# It is unknown what time Manila kept when the British occupied it from
# 1762-10-06 through 1764-04; for now assume it kept American time.
# On 1844-08-16, Narciso Clavería, governor-general of the
# Philippines, issued a proclamation announcing that 1844-12-30 was to
# be immediately followed by 1845-01-01; see R.H. van Gent's

#
# During WWII, Proclamation No. 789 fixed two periods of DST. The first period
# was set to continue only until January 31, 1942. But Manila was occupied by
# the Japanese earlier in the month....
#
# For the date of the adoption of standard time, Shank[s] gives 1899-05-11.
# The article is not able to state the basis of that. I guess it was based on
# a US War Department Circular issued on that date.
#	https://books.google.com/books?id=JZ1PAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA3-PA8
#
# However, according to other sources, standard time was adopted on
# 1899-09-06.  Also, the LMT was GMT+8:03:52

# From Paul Eggert (2024-09-05):
# The penultimate URL in P Chan's email refers to page 521 of
# Selga M, The Time Service in the Philippines.
# Proc Pan-Pacific Science Congress. Vol. 1 (1923), 519-532.
# It says, "The change from the meridian 120° 58' 04" to the 120th implied a
# change of 3 min. 52s.26 in time; consequently on 6th September, 1899,
# Manila Observatory gave the noon signal 3 min. 52s.26 later than before".
#
# Wikipedia says the US declared Manila liberated on March 4, 1945;
# this doesn't affect clocks, just our time zone abbreviation and DST flag.

# From Paul Goyette (2018-06-15) with URLs updated by Guy Harris (2024-02-15):
# In the Philippines, there is a national law, Republic Act No. 10535
# which declares the official time here as "Philippine Standard Time".
# The act [1] even specifies use of PST as the abbreviation, although
# the FAQ provided by PAGASA [2] uses the "acronym PhST to distinguish
# it from the Pacific Standard Time (PST)."

# [2] https://prsd.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/index.php/28-astronomy/302-philippine-standard-time
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-06-19):
# I surveyed recent news reports, and my impression is that "PST" is
# more popular among reliable English-language news sources.  This is
# not just a measure of Google hit counts: it's also the sizes and
# influence of the sources.  There is no current abbreviation for DST,
# so use "PDT", the usual American style.

#
# Japan's year-round bases in Antarctica match this since 1970.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-08-29):
# Time in Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Arabian peninsula was not
# standardized until 1968 or so; we don't know exactly when, and possibly it
# has never been made official.  Richard P Hunt, in "Islam city yielding to
# modern times", New York Times (1961-04-09), p 20, wrote that only airlines
# observed standard time, and that people in Jeddah mostly observed quasi-solar
# time, doing so by setting their watches at sunrise to 6 o'clock (or to 12
# o'clock for "Arab" time).
#
# Timekeeping differed depending on who you were and which part of Saudi
# Arabia you were in.  In 1969, Elias Antar wrote that although a common
# practice had been to set one's watch to 12:00 (i.e., midnight) at sunset -
# which meant that the time on one side of a mountain could differ greatly from
# the time on the other side - many foreigners set their watches to 6pm
# instead, while airlines instead used UTC +03 (except in Dhahran, where they
# used UTC +04), Aramco used UTC +03 with DST, and the Trans-Arabian Pipe Line
# Company used Aramco time in eastern Saudi Arabia and airline time in western.
# (The American Military Aid Advisory Group used plain UTC.)  Antar writes,
# "A man named Higgins, so the story goes, used to run a local power
# station. One day, the whole thing became too much for Higgins and he
# assembled his staff and laid down the law. 'I've had enough of this,' he
# shrieked. 'It is now 12 o'clock Higgins Time, and from now on this station is
# going to run on Higgins Time.' And so, until last year, it did."  See:
# Antar E. Dinner at When? Saudi Aramco World, 1969 March/April. 2-3.
# http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/196902/dinner.at.when.htm
# Also see: Antar EN. Arabian flying is confusing.
# Port Angeles (WA) Evening News. 1965-03-10. page 3.
#
# The TZ database cannot represent quasi-solar time; airline time is the best
# we can do.  The 1946 foreign air news digest of the U.S. Civil Aeronautics
# Board (OCLC 42299995) reported that the "... Arabian Government, inaugurated
# a weekly Dhahran-Cairo service, via the Saudi Arabian cities of Riyadh and
# Jidda, on March 14, 1947".  Shanks & Pottenger guessed 1950; go with the
# earlier date.
#
# Shanks & Pottenger also state that until 1968-05-01 Saudi Arabia had two
# time zones; the other zone, at UT +04, was in the far eastern part of
# the country.  Presumably this is documenting airline time.  Ignore this,
# as it's before our 1970 cutoff.

# From Paul Eggert (2013-02-21):
# Milne says "Madras mean time use from May 1, 1898.  Prior to this Colombo
# mean time, 5h. 4m. 21.9s. F., was used."  But 5:04:21.9 differs considerably
# from Colombo's meridian 5:19:24, so for now ignore Milne and stick with
# Shanks and Pottenger.

# by Shamindra in Daily News - Hot News Section
# <news:54rka5$m5h@mtinsc01-mgt.ops.worldnet.att.net> (1996-10-26):
# With effect from 12.30 a.m. on 26th October 1996
# Sri Lanka will be six (06) hours ahead of GMT.

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2006-04-14), quoting Sri Lanka News Online
# <http://news.sinhalaya.com/wmview.php?ArtID=11002> (2006-04-13):

# [The Tamil Tigers] never accepted the original 1996 time change and simply
# kept their clocks set five and a half hours ahead of Greenwich Mean
# Time (GMT), in line with neighbor India.
# From Paul Eggert (2006-04-18):
# People who live in regions under Tamil control can use [TZ='Asia/Kolkata'],
# as that zone has agreed with the Tamil areas since our cutoff date of 1970.

# From Sadika Sumanapala (2016-10-19):
# According to http://www.sltime.org (maintained by Measurement Units,
# Standards & Services Department, Sri Lanka) abbreviation for Sri Lanka
# standard time is SLST.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2016-10-18):
# "SLST" seems to be reasonably recent and rarely used outside time
# zone nerd sources.  I searched Google News and found three uses of
# it in the International Business Times of India in February and
# March of this year when discussing cricket match times, but nothing
# since then (though there has been a lot of cricket) and nothing in
# other English-language news sources.  Our old abbreviation "LKT" is
# even worse.  For now, let's use a numeric abbreviation; we can
# switch to "SLST" if it catches on.

# ...which reads (in part) "The Cabinet approved the suggestion of the

# and is the basis for the information below.
#
# The 1906 transition was effective July 1 and standardized Indochina to
# Phù Liễn Observatory, legally 104° 17' 17" east of Paris.
# It's unclear whether this meant legal Paris Mean Time (00:09:21) or
# the Paris Meridian; for now guess the former and round the exact
# 07:06:30.1333... to 07:06:30.13 as the legal spec used 66 2/3 ms precision.
# which is used below even though the modern-day Phù Liễn Observatory
# is closer to 07:06:31.  Abbreviate Phù Liễn Mean Time as PLMT.
#
# The following transitions occurred in Indochina in general (before 1954)
# and in South Vietnam in particular (after 1954):
# To 07:00 on 1911-05-01.
# To 08:00 on 1942-12-31 at 23:00.
# To 09:00 on 1945-03-14 at 23:00.
# To 07:00 on 1945-09-02 in Vietnam.
# To 08:00 on 1947-04-01 in French-controlled Indochina.
# To 07:00 on 1955-07-01 in South Vietnam.
# To 08:00 on 1959-12-31 at 23:00 in South Vietnam.
# To 07:00 on 1975-06-13 in South Vietnam.

# The Ho Chi Minh entry suffices for most purposes as it agrees with all of

# details are unknown and would likely be too voluminous for this database.
#
# For timestamps in north Vietnam back to 1970 (the tzdb cutoff),
# use Asia/Bangkok; see the VN entries in the file zone1970.tab.
# For timestamps before 1970, see Asia/Hanoi in the file 'backzone'.

# Queensland
#
# From Alex Livingston (1996-11-01):
# I have heard or read more than once that some resort islands off the coast
# of Queensland chose to keep observing daylight-saving time even after
# Queensland ceased to.
#
# From Paul Eggert (1996-11-22):
# IATA SSIM (1993-02/1994-09) say that the Holiday Islands (Hayman, Lindeman,
# Hamilton) observed DST for two years after the rest of Queensland stopped.
# Hamilton is the largest, but there is also a Hamilton in Victoria,
# so use Lindeman.
#
# From J William Piggott (2016-02-20):
# There is no location named Holiday Islands in Queensland Australia; holiday
# islands is a colloquial term used globally.  Hayman and Lindeman are at the
# north and south extremes of the Whitsunday Islands archipelago, and
# Hamilton is in between; it is reasonable to believe that this time zone
# applies to all of the Whitsundays.

# Cook Is
#
# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2021-03-24):
# In 1899 the Cook Islands celebrated Christmas twice to correct the calendar.
# According to the old books, missionaries were unaware of
# the International Date line, when they came from Sydney.
# Thus the Cook Islands were one day ahead....

# ... Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives, 1900
# https://atojs.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/atojs?a=d&d=AJHR1900-I.2.1.2.3
# (page 20)
#
# From Michael Deckers (2021-03-24):
# ... in the Cook Island Act of 1915-10-11, online at
# http://www.paclii.org/ck/legis/ck-nz_act/cia1915132/
# "651. The hour of the day shall in each of the islands included in the
#  Cook Islands be determined in accordance with the meridian of that island."
# so that local (mean?) time was still used in Rarotonga (and Niue) in 1915.
# This was changed in the Cook Island Amendment Act of 1952-10-16 ...
# http://www.paclii.org/ck/legis/ck-nz_act/ciaa1952212/
# "651 (1) The hour of the day in each of the islands included in the Cook
#  Islands, other than Niue, shall be determined as if each island were
#  situated on the meridian one hundred and fifty-seven degrees thirty minutes
#  West of Greenwich.  (2) The hour of the day in the Island of Niue shall be
#  determined as if that island were situated on the meridian one hundred and
#  seventy degrees West of Greenwich."
# This act does not state when it takes effect, so one has to assume it
# applies since 1952-10-16.  But there is the possibility that the act just
# legalized prior existing practice, as we had seen with the Guernsey law of
# 1913-06-18 for the switch in 1909-04-19.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2021-03-24):
# Transitions after 1952 are from Shanks & Pottenger.

# US minor outlying islands

# Howland, Baker
# Howland was mined for guano by American companies 1857-1878 and British
# 1886-1891; Baker was similar but exact dates are not known.
# Inhabited by civilians 1935-1942; U.S. military bases 1943-1944;
# uninhabited thereafter.
# Howland observed Hawaii Standard Time (UT -10:30) in 1937;
# see page 206 of Elgen M. Long and Marie K. Long,
# Amelia Earhart: the Mystery Solved, Simon & Schuster (2000).
# So most likely Howland and Baker observed Hawaii Time from 1935
# until they were abandoned after the war.

# Johnston
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-02-10):
# Sometimes Johnston kept Hawaii time, and sometimes it was an hour behind.
# Details are uncertain.  We have no data for Johnston after 1970, so
# treat it like Hawaii for now.  Since Johnston is now uninhabited,
# its link to Pacific/Honolulu is in the 'backward' file.
#
# In his memoirs of June 6th to October 4, 1945
# <http://www.315bw.org/Herb_Bach.htm> (2005), Herbert C. Bach writes,
# "We started our letdown to Kwajalein Atoll and landed there at 5:00 AM
# Johnston time, 1:30 AM Kwajalein time."  This was in June 1945, and
# confirms that Johnston kept the same time as Honolulu in summer 1945.
#
# From Lyle McElhaney (2014-03-11):
# [W]hen JI was being used for that [atomic bomb] testing, the time being used
# was not Hawaiian time but rather the same time being used on the ships,
# which had a GMT offset of -11 hours.  This apparently applied to at least the
# time from Operation Newsreel (Hardtack I/Teak shot, 1958-08-01) to the last
# Operation Fishbowl shot (Tightrope, 1962-11-04).... [See] Herman Hoerlin,
# "The United States High-Altitude Test Experience: A Review Emphasizing the
# Impact on the Environment", Los Alamos LA-6405, Oct 1976.
# https://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/docs1/00322994.pdf
# See the table on page 4 where he lists GMT and local times for the tests; a

# Minus One Hour".

# Australia

# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
# Daylight saving time has long been controversial in Australia, pitting
# region against region, rural against urban, and local against global.
# For example, in her review of Graeme Davison's _The Unforgiving
# Minute: how Australians learned to tell the time_ (1993), Perth native
# Phillipa J Martyr wrote, "The section entitled 'Saving Daylight' was
# very informative, but was (as can, sadly, only be expected from a
# Melbourne-based study) replete with the usual chuckleheaded
# Queenslanders and straw-chewing yokels from the West prattling fables
# about fading curtains and crazed farm animals."

# From Paul Eggert (2005-12-08):
# Implementation Dates of Daylight Saving Time within Australia
# http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/dst_times.shtml
# summarizes daylight saving issues in Australia.

# From Arthur David Olson (2005-12-12):
# Lawlink NSW:Daylight Saving in New South Wales
# http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/Corporate/ll_agdinfo.nsf/pages/community_relations_daylight_saving
# covers New South Wales in particular.

# From John Mackin (1991-03-06):
# We in Australia have _never_ referred to DST as 'daylight' time.
# It is called 'summer' time.  Now by a happy coincidence, 'summer'
# and 'standard' happen to start with the same letter; hence, the
# abbreviation does _not_ change...
# The legislation does not actually define abbreviations, at least
# in this State, but the abbreviation is just commonly taken to be the
# initials of the phrase, and the legislation here uniformly uses
# the phrase 'summer time' and does not use the phrase 'daylight
# time'.
# Announcers on the Commonwealth radio network, the ABC (for Australian
# Broadcasting Commission), use the phrases 'Eastern Standard Time'
# or 'Eastern Summer Time'.  (Note, though, that as I say in the
# current australasia file, there is really no such thing.)  Announcers
# on its overseas service, Radio Australia, use the same phrases
# prefixed by the word 'Australian' when referring to local times;
# time announcements on that service, naturally enough, are made in UTC.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
#
# Inspired by Mackin's remarks quoted above, earlier versions of this
# file used "EST" for both Eastern Standard Time and Eastern Summer
# Time in Australia, and similarly for "CST", "CWST", and "WST".
# However, these abbreviations were confusing and were not common
# practice among Australians, and there were justifiable complaints
# about them, so I attempted to survey current Australian usage.
# For the tz database, the full English phrase is not that important;
# what matters is the abbreviation.  It's difficult to survey the web
# directly for abbreviation usage, as there are so many false hits for
# strings like "EST" and "EDT", so I looked for pages that defined an
# abbreviation for eastern or central DST in Australia, and got the
# following numbers of unique hits for the listed Google queries:
#
#   10 "Eastern Daylight Time AEST" site:au [some are false hits]
#   10 "Eastern Summer Time AEST" site:au
#   10 "Summer Time AEDT" site:au
#   13 "EDST Eastern Daylight Saving Time" site:au
#   18 "Summer Time ESST" site:au
#   28 "Eastern Daylight Saving Time EDST" site:au
#   39 "EDT Eastern Daylight Time" site:au [some are false hits]
#   53 "Eastern Daylight Time EDT" site:au [some are false hits]
#   54 "AEDT Australian Eastern Daylight Time" site:au
#  182 "Eastern Daylight Time AEDT" site:au
#
#   17 "Central Daylight Time CDT" site:au [some are false hits]
#   46 "Central Daylight Time ACDT" site:au
#
# I tried several other variants (e.g., "Eastern Summer Time EST") but
# they all returned fewer than 10 unique hits.  I also looked for pages
# mentioning both "western standard time" and an abbreviation, since
# there is no WST in the US to generate false hits, and found:
#
#  156 "western standard time" AWST site:au
#  226 "western standard time" WST site:au
#
# I then surveyed the top ten newspapers in Australia by circulation as
# listed in Wikipedia, using Google queries like "AEDT site:heraldsun.com.au"
# and obtaining estimated counts from the initial page of search results.
# All ten papers greatly preferred "AEDT" to "EDT".  The papers
# surveyed were the Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph, The Courier-Mail,
# The Sydney Morning Herald, The West Australian, The Age, The Advertiser,
# The Australian, The Financial Review, and The Herald (Newcastle).
#
# I also searched for historical usage, to see whether abbreviations
# like "AEDT" are new.  A Trove search <http://trove.nla.gov.au/>
# found only one newspaper (The Canberra Times) with a house style
# dating back to the 1970s, I expect because other newspapers weren't
# fully indexed.  The Canberra Times strongly preferred abbreviations
# like "AEDT".  The first occurrence of "AEDT" was a World Weather
# column (1971-11-17, page 24), and of "ACDT" was a Scoreboard column
# (1993-01-24, p 16).  The style was the typical usage but was not
# strictly enforced; for example, "Welcome to the twilight zones ..."
# (1994-10-29, p 1) uses the abbreviations AEST/AEDT, CST/CDT, and
# WST, and goes on to say, "The confusion and frustration some feel
# about the lack of uniformity among Australia's six states and two
# territories has prompted one group to form its very own political
# party -- the Sydney-based Daylight Saving Extension Party."
#
# I also surveyed federal government sources.  They did not agree:
#
#   The Australian Government (2014-03-26)
#   http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/our-country/time
#   (This document was produced by the Department of Finance.)

#
#   Parliamentary Library (2008-11-10)
#   https://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/library/pubs/rp/2008-09/09rp14.pdf
#   EST CST WST preferred for standard time; AEST AEDT ACST ACDT also used
#
#   The Transport Safety Bureau has an extensive series of accident reports,
#   and investigators seem to use whatever abbreviation they like.
#   Googling site:atsb.gov.au found the following number of unique hits:
#   311 "ESuT", 195 "EDT", 26 "AEDT", 83 "CSuT", 46 "CDT".
#   "_SuT" tended to appear in older reports, and "A_DT" tended to
#   appear in reports of events with international implications.
#
# From the above it appears that there is a working consensus in
# Australia to use trailing "DT" for daylight saving time; although
# some sources use trailing "SST" or "ST" or "SuT" they are by far in
# the minority.  The case for leading "A" is weaker, but since it
# seems to be preferred in the overall web and is preferred in all
# the leading newspaper websites and in many government departments,
# it has a stronger case than omitting the leading "A".  The current
# version of the database therefore uses abbreviations like "AEST" and
# "AEDT" for Australian time zones.

# From Paul Eggert (1995-12-19):
# Shanks & Pottenger report 2:00 for all autumn changes in Australia and NZ.
# Mark Prior writes that his newspaper
# reports that NSW's fall 1995 change will occur at 2:00,
# but Robert Elz says it's been 3:00 in Victoria since 1970
# and perhaps the newspaper's '2:00' is referring to standard time.
# For now we'll continue to assume 2:00s for changes since 1960.

# From Rives McDow (2002-04-09):
# The most interesting region I have found consists of three towns on the
# southern coast....  South Australia observes daylight saving time; Western
# Australia does not.  The two states are one and a half hours apart.  The
# residents decided to forget about this nonsense of changing the clock so
# much and set the local time 20 hours and 45 minutes from the
# international date line, or right in the middle of the time of South
# Australia and Western Australia....
#
# From Paul Eggert (2002-04-09):
# This is confirmed by the section entitled
# "What's the deal with time zones???" in
# http://www.earthsci.unimelb.edu.au/~awatkins/null.html
#
# From Alex Livingston (2006-12-07):
# ... it was just on four years ago that I drove along the Eyre Highway,
# which passes through eastern Western Australia close to the southern
# coast of the continent.
#
# I paid particular attention to the time kept there. There can be no
# dispute that UTC+08:45 was considered "the time" from the border
# village just inside the border with South Australia to as far west
# as just east of Caiguna. There can also be no dispute that Eucla is
# the largest population centre in this zone....
#
# Now that Western Australia is observing daylight saving, the
# question arose whether this part of the state would follow suit. I
# just called the border village and confirmed that indeed they have,
# meaning that they are now observing UTC+09:45.
#
# (2006-12-09):
# I personally doubt that either experimentation with daylight saving
# in WA or its introduction in SA had anything to do with the genesis
# of this time zone.  My hunch is that it's been around since well
# before 1975.  I remember seeing it noted on road maps decades ago.

# On KQED's "City Arts and Lectures" program last night I heard an

# discussing his book "The Sun in the Church: Cathedrals as Solar
# Observatories"[1], and in particular the Shrine of Remembrance[2] located
# in Melbourne, Australia.
#
# Apparently the shrine's main purpose is a beam of sunlight which
# illuminates a special spot on the floor at the 11th hour of the 11th day
# of the 11th month (Remembrance Day) every year in memory of Australia's
# fallen WWI soldiers.  And if you go there on Nov. 11, at 11am local time,
# you will indeed see the sunbeam illuminate the special spot at the
# expected time.
#
# However, that is only because of some special mirror contraption that had
# to be employed, since due to daylight savings time, the true solar time of
# the remembrance moment occurs one hour later (or earlier?).  Perhaps
# someone with more information on this jury-rig can tell us more.

# New South Wales

# From Arthur David Olson:
# New South Wales and subjurisdictions have their own ideas of a fun time.
# Based on law library research by John Mackin,
# who notes:
#	In Australia, time is not legislated federally, but rather by the
#	individual states.  Thus, while such terms as "Eastern Standard Time"
#	[I mean, of course, Australian EST, not any other kind] are in common
#	use, _they have NO REAL MEANING_, as they are not defined in the
#	legislation.  This is very important to understand.
#	I have researched New South Wales time only...

# From Eric Ulevik (1999-05-26):

# Lord Howe Island is located off the New South Wales coast, and is half an
# hour ahead of NSW time.

# From James Lonergan, Secretary, Lord Howe Island Board (2000-01-27):
# Lord Howe Island summer time in 2000/2001 will commence on the same
# date as the rest of NSW (i.e. 2000-08-27).  For your information the
# Lord Howe Island Board (controlling authority for the Island) is
# seeking the community's views on various options for summer time
# arrangements on the Island, e.g. advance clocks by 1 full hour
# instead of only 30 minutes.  [Dependent] on the wishes of residents
# the Board may approach the NSW government to change the existing
# arrangements.  The starting date for summer time on the Island will
# however always coincide with the rest of NSW.

# From James Lonergan, Secretary, Lord Howe Island Board (2000-10-25):
# Lord Howe Island advances clocks by 30 minutes during DST in NSW and retards
# clocks by 30 minutes when DST finishes. Since DST was most recently
# introduced in NSW, the "changeover" time on the Island has been 02:00 as
# shown on clocks on LHI. I guess this means that for 30 minutes at the start
# of DST, LHI is actually 1 hour ahead of the rest of NSW.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# For Lord Howe dates we use Shanks & Pottenger through 1989, and
# Lonergan thereafter.  For times we use Lonergan.

# From Paul Eggert (2007-07-23):
# See "southeast Australia" above for 2008 and later.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2009-04-28):
# According to the official press release, South Australia's extended daylight
# saving period will continue with the same rules as used during the 2008-2009
# summer (southern hemisphere).
#
# From
# http://www.safework.sa.gov.au/uploaded_files/DaylightDatesSet.pdf
# The extended daylight saving period that South Australia has been trialling
# for over the last year is now set to be ongoing.
# Daylight saving will continue to start on the first Sunday in October each
# year and finish on the first Sunday in April the following year.
# Industrial Relations Minister, Paul Caica, says this provides South Australia
# with a consistent half hour time difference with NSW, Victoria, Tasmania and
# the ACT for all 52 weeks of the year...

# According to Google Books snippet view, a speaker in the New Zealand

# Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands and Marcus Island (Minami-Tori-shima)

# From Wakaba (2019-01-28) via Phake Nick:
# National Diet Library of Japan has several reports by Japanese Government
# officers that describe the time used in islands when they visited there.
# According to them (and other sources such as newspapers), standard time UTC
# + 10 (JST + 1) and DST UTC + 11 (JST + 2) was used until its return to Japan
# at 1968-06-26 00:00 JST.  The exact periods of DST are still unknown.
# I guessed Guam, Mariana, and Bonin and Marcus districts might have
# synchronized their DST periods, but reports imply they had their own
# decisions, i.e. there were three or more different time zones....
#
# https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/小笠原諸島の標準時

# From Phake Nick (2019-02-12):
# Because their last time change to return to Japanese time when they returned
# to Japanese rule was right before 1970, ... per the current tz database
# rule, the information doesn't warrant creation of a new timezone for Bonin
# Islands itself and is thus as an anecdotal note for interest purpose only.
# ... [The abovementioned link] described some special timekeeping phenomenon
# regarding Marcus island, another remote island currently owned by Japanese
# in the same administrative unit as Bonin Islands.  Many reports claim that
# the American coastal guard on the American quarter of the island use its own
# coastal guard time, and most sources describe the time as UTC+11, being two
# hours faster than JST used by some Japanese personnel on the island.  Some
# sites describe it as same as Wake Island/Guam time although it would be
# incorrect to be same as Guam.  And then in a few Japanese governmental
# report from 1980s (from National Institute of Information and Communications
# Technology) regarding the construction of VLBI facility on the Marcus
# Island, it claimed that there are three time standards being used on the
# island at the time which include not just JST (UTC+9) or [US]CG time
# (UTC+11) but also a JMSDF time (UTC+10) (Japan Maritime Self-Defense
# Force).  Unfortunately there are no other sources that mentioned such time
# and there are also no information on things like how the time was used.


# Fiji

# Howse writes (p 153) that in 1879 the British governor of Fiji
# enacted an ordinance standardizing the islands on Antipodean Time

# Fiji will introduce DST effective 0200 local time, 1998-11-01
# until 0300 local time 1999-02-28.  Each year the DST period will
# be from the first Sunday in November until the last Sunday in February.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-01-08):

# Kanton

# From Paul Eggert (2021-05-27):
# Kiribati's +13 timezone is represented by Kanton, its only populated
# island.  (It was formerly spelled "Canton", but Gilbertese lacks "C".)
# Kanton was settled on 1937-08-31 by two British radio operators
# <https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1937v02/d94>;
# Americans came the next year and built an airfield, partly to
# establish airline service and perhaps partly anticipating the
# next war.  Aside from the war, the airfield was used by commercial
# airlines until long-range jets became standard; although currently
# for emergency use only, China says it is considering rebuilding the
# airfield for high-end niche tourism.  Kanton has about two dozen
# people, caretakers who rotate in from the rest of Kiribati in 2-5
# year shifts, and who use some of the leftover structures

# However the AP article is vague and possibly wrong about this.  The article
# says the earlier switch was "about 40 years ago when the United States
# Army established a missile test range here".  However, the Kwajalein Test
# Center was established on 1960-10-01 and was run by the US Navy.  It was

# Given that Shanks was right on the money about the 1993 change, I'm inclined

# N Mariana Is, Guam

# From Phake Nick (2018-10-27):
# Guam Island was briefly annexed by Japan during ... year 1941-1944 ...
# however there are no detailed information about what time it use during that
# period.  It would probably be reasonable to assume Guam use GMT+9 during
# that period of time like the surrounding area.

# From Paul Eggert (2023-01-23):
# Howse writes (p 153) "The Spaniards, on the other hand, reached the
# Philippines and the Ladrones from America," and implies that the Ladrones
# (now called the Marianas) kept American date for quite some time.
# For now, we assume the Ladrones switched at the same time as the Philippines;
# see Asia/Manila.
#
# Use 1941-12-10 and 1944-07-31 for Guam WWII transitions, as the rough start
# and end of Japanese control of Agana.  We don't know whether the Northern
# Marianas followed Guam's DST rules from 1959 through 1977; for now, assume
# they did as that avoids the need for a separate zone due to our 1970 cutoff.
#
# US Public Law 106-564 (2000-12-23) made UT +10 the official standard time,
# under the name "Chamorro standard time".  There is no official abbreviation,
# but Congressman Robert A. Underwood, author of the bill that became law,
# wrote in a press release (2000-12-27) that he will seek the use of "ChST".

# See also the commentary for Micronesia.


# Marshall Is
# See the commentary for Micronesia.


# Micronesia (and nearby)

# From Paul Eggert (2018-11-18):
# Like the Ladrones (see Guam commentary), assume the Spanish East Indies
# kept American time until the Philippines switched at the end of 1844.

# From Paul Eggert (1999-10-29):
# The Federated States of Micronesia Visitors Board writes in
# The Federated States of Micronesia - Visitor Information (1999-01-26)
# http://www.fsmgov.org/info/clocks.html
# that Truk and Yap are UT +10, and Ponape and Kosrae are +11.
# We don't know when Kosrae switched from +12; assume January 1 for now.

# From Phake Nick (2018-10-27):
#
# From a Japanese wiki site https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/南洋群島の標準時
# ...
# For "Southern Islands" (modern region of Mariana + Palau + Federation of
# Micronesia + Marshall Islands):
#
# A 1906 Japanese magazine shown the Caroline Islands and Mariana Islands
# who was occupied by Germany at the time as GMT+10, together with the like
# of German New Guinea.  However there is a marking saying it have not been
# implemented (yet).  No further information after that were found.
#
# Japan invaded those islands in 1914, and records shows that they were
# instructed to use JST at the time.
#
# 1915 January telecommunication record on the Jaluit Atoll shows they use
# the meridian of 170E as standard time (GMT+11:20), which is similar to the
# longitude of the atoll.
# 1915 February record say the 170E standard time is to be used until
# February 9 noon, and after February 9 noon they are to use JST.
# However these are time used within the Japanese Military at the time and
# probably does not reflect the time used by local resident at the time (that
# is if they keep their own time back then)
#
# In January 1919 the occupying force issued a command that split the area
# into three different timezone with meridian of 135E, 150E, 165E (JST+0, +1,
# +2), and the command was to become effective from February 1 of the same
# year.  Despite the target of the command is still only for the occupying
# force itself, further publication have described the time as the standard
# time for the occupied area and thus it can probably be seen as such.
#  * Area that use meridian of 135E: Palau and Yap civil administration area
#    (Southern Islands Western Standard Time)
#  * Area that use meridian of 150E: Truk (Chuuk) and Saipan civil
#    administration area (Southern Islands Central Standard Time)
#  * Area that use meridian of 165E: Ponape (Pohnpei) and Jaluit civil
#    administration area (Southern Islands Eastern Standard Time).
#  * In the next few years Japanese occupation of those islands have been
#    formalized via League of Nation Mandate (South Pacific Mandate) and formal
#    governance structure have been established, these district [become
#    subprefectures] and timezone classification have been inherited as standard
#    time of the area.
#  * Saipan subprefecture include Mariana islands (exclude Guam which was
#    occupied by America at the time), Palau and Yap subprefecture rule the
#    Western Caroline Islands with 137E longitude as border, Truk and Ponape
#    subprefecture rule the Eastern Caroline Islands with 154E as border, Ponape
#    subprefecture also rule part of Marshall Islands to the west of 164E
#    starting from (1918?) and Jaluit subprefecture rule the rest of the
#    Marshall Islands.
#
# And then in year 1937, an announcement was made to change the time in the
# area into 2 timezones:
#  * Area that use meridian of 135E: area administered by Palau, Yap and
#    Saipan subprefecture (Southern Islands Western Standard Time)
#  * Area that use meridian of 150E: area administered by Truk (Chuuk),
#    Ponape (Pohnpei) and Jaluit subprefecture (Southern Islands Eastern
#    Standard Time)
#
# Another announcement issued in 1941 say that on April 1 that year,
# standard time of the Southern Islands would be changed to use the meridian
# of 135E (GMT+9), and thus abolishing timezone different within the area.
#
# Then Pacific theater of WWII started and Japan slowly lose control on the
# island.  The webpage I linked above contain no information during this
# period of time....
#
# After the end of WWII, in 1946 February, a document written by the
# (former?) Japanese military personnel describe there are 3 hours time
# different between Caroline islands time/Wake island time and the Chungking
# time, which would mean the time being used there at the time was GMT+10.
#
# After that, the area become Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands
# under American administration from year 1947.  The site listed some
# American/International books/maps/publications about time used in those
# area during this period of time but they doesn't seems to be reliable
# information so it would be the best if someone know where can more reliable
# information can be found.
#
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-11-18):
#
# For the above, use vague dates like "1914" and "1945" for transitions that
# plausibly exist but for which the details are not known.  The information
# for Wake is too sketchy to act on.
#
# The 1906 GMT+10 info about German-controlled islands might not have been
# done, so omit it from the data for now.
#
# The Jaluit info governs Kwajalein.


# Midway

# From Charles T O'Connor, KMTH DJ (1956),
# quoted in the KTMH section of the Radio Heritage Collection
# <http://radiodx.com/spdxr/KMTH.htm> (2002-12-31):
# For the past two months we've been on what is known as Daylight
# Saving Time.  This time has put us on air at 5am in the morning,
# your time down there in New Zealand.  Starting September 2, 1956
# we'll again go back to Standard Time.  This'll mean that we'll go to
# air at 6am your time.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2003-03-23):
# We don't know the date of that quote, but we'll guess they
# started DST on June 3.  Possibly DST was observed other years
# in Midway, but we have no record of it.

# Nauru

# From Phake Nick (2018-10-31):
# Currently, the tz database say Nauru use LMT until 1921, and then
# switched to GMT+11:30 for the next two decades.
# However, a number of timezone map published in America/Japan back then
# showed its timezone as GMT+11 per https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/ナウルの標準時
# And it would also be nice if the 1921 transition date could be sourced.

# The 1921-01-15 introduction of standard time is in Shanks; it is also in

# Pitcairn

# From Rives McDow (1999-11-08):
# A Proclamation was signed by the Governor of Pitcairn on the 27th March 1998
# with regard to Pitcairn Standard Time.  The Proclamation is as follows.
#
#	The local time for general purposes in the Islands shall be
#	Co-ordinated Universal time minus 8 hours and shall be known
#	as Pitcairn Standard Time.
#
# ... I have also seen Pitcairn listed as UTC minus 9 hours in several
# references, and can only assume that this was an error in interpretation
# somehow in light of this proclamation.

# From Rives McDow (1999-11-09):
# The Proclamation regarding Pitcairn time came into effect on 27 April 1998
# ... at midnight.

# From Howie Phelps (1999-11-10), who talked to a Pitcairner via shortwave:
# Betty Christian told me yesterday that their local time is the same as
# Pacific Standard Time. They used to be ½ hour different from us here in
# Sacramento but it was changed a couple of years ago.


# (Western) Samoa and American Samoa

# Howse writes (p 153) that after the 1879 standardization on Antipodean
# time by the British governor of Fiji, the King of Samoa decided to change
# "the date in his kingdom from the Antipodean to the American system,
# ordaining - by a masterpiece of diplomatic flattery - that
# the Fourth of July should be celebrated twice in that year."
# This happened in 1892, according to the Evening News (Sydney) of 1892-07-20.
# https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/idl/idl_alaska_samoa.htm

# Although Shanks & Pottenger says they both switched to UT -11:30
# in 1911, and to -11 in 1950. many earlier sources give -11
# for American Samoa, e.g., the US National Bureau of Standards
# circular "Standard Time Throughout the World", 1932.
# Assume American Samoa switched to -11 in 1911, not 1950,
# and that after 1950 they agreed until (western) Samoa skipped a
# day in 2011.  Assume also that the Samoas follow the US and New
# Zealand's "ST"/"DT" style of daylight-saving abbreviations.


# Tonga

# From Paul Eggert (2021-03-04):
# In 1943 "The standard time kept is 12 hrs. 19 min. 12 sec. fast
# on Greenwich mean time." according to the Admiralty's Hydrographic
# Dept., Pacific Islands Pilot, Vol. II, 7th ed., 1943, p 360.

# From Michael Deckers (2021-03-03):
# [Ian R Bartky: "One Time Fits All: The Campaigns for Global Uniformity".
# Stanford University Press. 2007. p. 255]:
# On 10 September 1945 Tonga adopted a standard time 12 hours,
# 20 minutes in advance of Greenwich.

# From Paul Eggert (1996-01-22):
# Today's _Wall Street Journal_ (p 1) reports that "Tonga has been plotting
# to sneak ahead of [New Zealanders] by introducing daylight-saving time."
# Since Kiribati has moved the Date Line it's not clear what Tonga will do.

# Don Mundell writes in the 1997-02-20 Tonga Chronicle
# How Tonga became 'The Land where Time Begins':
# http://www.tongatapu.net.to/tonga/homeland/timebegins.htm
#
# Until 1941 Tonga maintained a standard time 50 minutes ahead of NZST
# 12 hours and 20 minutes ahead of GMT.  When New Zealand adjusted its
# standard time in 1940s, Tonga had the choice of subtracting from its
# local time to come on the same standard time as New Zealand or of
# advancing its time to maintain the differential of 13°
# (approximately 50 minutes ahead of New Zealand time).
#
# Because His Majesty King Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV, then Crown Prince
# Tungī, preferred to ensure Tonga's title as the land where time
# begins, the Legislative Assembly approved the latter change.
#
# But some of the older, more conservative members from the outer
# islands objected. "If at midnight on Dec. 31, we move ahead 40
# minutes, as your Royal Highness wishes, what becomes of the 40
# minutes we have lost?"
#
# The Crown Prince, presented an unanswerable argument: "Remember that
# on the World Day of Prayer, you would be the first people on Earth
# to say your prayers in the morning."
#
# From Tim Parenti (2021-09-13), per Paul Eggert (2006-03-22) and Michael
# Deckers (2021-03-03):
# Mundell places the transition from +12:20 to +13 in 1941, while Shanks &
# Pottenger say the transition was on 1968-10-01.
#
# The Air Almanac published contemporaneous tables of standard times,
# which listed +12:20 as of Nov 1960 and +13 as of Mar 1961:
#   Nov 1960: https://books.google.com/books?id=bVgtWM6kPZUC&pg=SL1-PA19
#   Mar 1961: https://books.google.com/books?id=W2nItAul4g0C&pg=SL1-PA19
# (Thanks to P Chan for pointing us toward these sources.)
# This agrees with Bartky, who writes that "since 1961 [Tonga's] official time
# has been thirteen hours in advance of Greenwich time" (p. 202) and further
# writes in an endnote that this was because "the legislation was amended" on
# 1960-10-19. (p. 255)
#
# Without greater specificity, presume that Bartky and the Air Almanac point to
# a 1961-01-01 transition, as Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV was still Crown Prince in
# 1961 and this still jives with the gist of Mundell's telling, and go with
# this over Shanks & Pottenger.

# From Eric Ulevik (1999-05-03):
# Tonga's director of tourism, who is also secretary of the National Millennium
# Committee, has a plan to get Tonga back in front.
# He has proposed a one-off move to tropical daylight saving for Tonga from
# October to March, which has won approval in principle from the Tongan
# Government.

# From Steffen Thorsen (1999-09-09):
# * Tonga will introduce DST in November
#
# I was given this link by John Letts:
# http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/asia-pacific/newsid_424000/424764.stm
#
# I have not been able to find exact dates for the transition in November
# yet. By reading this article it seems like Fiji will be 14 hours ahead
# of UTC as well, but as far as I know Fiji will only be 13 hours ahead
# (12 + 1 hour DST).

# From Arthur David Olson (1999-09-20):
# According to <http://www.tongaonline.com/news/sept1799.html>:
# "Daylight Savings Time will take effect on Oct. 2 through April 15, 2000
# and annually thereafter from the first Saturday in October through the
# third Saturday of April.  Under the system approved by Privy Council on
# Sept. 10, clocks must be turned ahead one hour on the opening day and
# set back an hour on the closing date."
# Alas, no indication of the time of day.

# From Rives McDow (1999-10-06):
# Tonga started its Daylight Saving on Saturday morning October 2nd at 0200am.
# Daylight Saving ends on April 16 at 0300am which is Sunday morning.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2000-10-31):
# Back in March I found a notice on the website http://www.tongaonline.com
# that Tonga changed back to standard time one month early, on March 19
# instead of the original reported date April 16. Unfortunately, the article
# is no longer available on the site, and I did not make a copy of the
# text, and I have forgotten to report it here.
# (Original URL was <http://www.tongaonline.com/news/march162000.htm>)

# From Rives McDow (2000-12-01):
# Tonga is observing DST as of 2000-11-04 and will stop on 2001-01-27.

# From Sione Moala-Mafi (2001-09-20) via Rives McDow:
# At 2:00am on the first Sunday of November, the standard time in the Kingdom
# shall be moved forward by one hour to 3:00am.  At 2:00am on the last Sunday
# of January the standard time in the Kingdom shall be moved backward by one
# hour to 1:00am.

# From Pulu ʻAnau (2002-11-05):
# The law was for 3 years, supposedly to get renewed.  It wasn't.

# From Pulu ʻAnau (2016-10-27):
# http://mic.gov.to/news-today/press-releases/6375-daylight-saving-set-to-run-from-6-november-2016-to-15-january-2017
# Cannot find anyone who knows the rules, has seen the duration or has seen
# the cabinet decision, but it appears we are following Fiji's rule set.
#
# From Tim Parenti (2016-10-26):
# Assume Tonga will observe DST from the first Sunday in November at 02:00
# through the third Sunday in January at 03:00, like Fiji, for now.

# From David Wade (2017-10-18):
# In August government was dissolved by the King.  The current prime minister
# continued in office in care taker mode.  It is easy to see that few
# decisions will be made until elections 16th November.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-10-18):
# For now, guess that DST is discontinued.  That's what the IATA is guessing.


###############################################################################

# The International Date Line

# From Gwillim Law (2000-01-03):
#
# The International Date Line is not defined by any international standard,
# convention, or treaty.  Mapmakers are free to draw it as they please.
# Reputable mapmakers will simply ensure that every point of land appears on
# the correct side of the IDL, according to the date legally observed there.
#
# When Kiribati adopted a uniform date in 1995, thereby moving the Phoenix and
# Line Islands to the west side of the IDL (or, if you prefer, moving the IDL
# to the east side of the Phoenix and Line Islands), I suppose that most
# mapmakers redrew the IDL following the boundary of Kiribati.  Even that line
# has a rather arbitrary nature.  The straight-line boundaries between Pacific
# island nations that are shown on many maps are based on an international
# convention, but are not legally binding national borders.... The date is
# governed by the IDL; therefore, even on the high seas, there may be some
# places as late as fourteen hours later than UTC.  And, since the IDL is not
# an international standard, there are some places on the high seas where the
# correct date is ambiguous.

# From Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_time> (2023-01-23):
# The nautical time zone system is analogous to the terrestrial time zone
# system for use on high seas.  Under the system time changes are required for
# changes of longitude in one-hour steps.  The one-hour step corresponds to a
# time zone width of 15° longitude.  The 15° gore that is offset from GMT or
# UT1 (not UTC) by twelve hours is bisected by the nautical date line into two
# 7°30' gores that differ from GMT by ±12 hours.  A nautical date line is
# implied but not explicitly drawn on time zone maps.  It follows the 180th
# meridian except where it is interrupted by territorial waters adjacent to
# land, forming gaps: it is a pole-to-pole dashed line.

# From Paul Eggert (2023-01-23):
# The American Practical Navigator <https://msi.nga.mil/Publications/APN>,
# 2019 edition, merely says that the International Date Line
# "coincides with the 180th meridian over most of its length."

# Britain (United Kingdom) and Ireland (Eire)

# From Peter Ilieve (1994-07-06):
#
# On 17 Jan 1994 the Independent, a UK quality newspaper, had a piece about
# historical vistas along the Thames in west London. There was a photo
# and a sketch map showing some of the sightlines involved. One paragraph
# of the text said:
#
# 'An old stone obelisk marking a forgotten terrestrial meridian stands
# beside the river at Kew. In the 18th century, before time and longitude
# was standardised by the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, scholars observed
# this stone and the movement of stars from Kew Observatory nearby. They
# made their calculations and set the time for the Horse Guards and Parliament,
# but now the stone is obscured by scrubwood and can only be seen by walking
# along the towpath within a few yards of it.'
#
# I have a one inch to one mile map of London and my estimate of the stone's
# position is 51° 28' 30" N, 0° 18' 45" W. The longitude should
# be within about ±2". The Ordnance Survey grid reference is TQ172761.
#
# [This yields STDOFF = -0:01:15 for London LMT in the 18th century.]

# From Paul Eggert (1993-11-18):
#
# Howse writes that Britain was the first country to use standard time.
# The railways cared most about the inconsistencies of local mean time,
# and it was they who forced a uniform time on the country.
# The original idea was credited to Dr. William Hyde Wollaston (1766-1828)
# and was popularized by Abraham Follett Osler (1808-1903).
# The first railway to adopt London time was the Great Western Railway
# in November 1840; other railways followed suit, and by 1847 most
# (though not all) railways used London time.  On 1847-09-22 the
# Railway Clearing House, an industry standards body, recommended that GMT be
# adopted at all stations as soon as the General Post Office permitted it.
# The transition occurred on 12-01 for the L&NW, the Caledonian,
# and presumably other railways; the January 1848 Bradshaw's lists many
# railways as using GMT.  By 1855 the vast majority of public
# clocks in Britain were set to GMT (though some, like the great clock
# on Tom Tower at Christ Church, Oxford, were fitted with two minute hands,
# one for local time and one for GMT).  The last major holdout was the legal
# system, which stubbornly stuck to local time for many years, leading
# to oddities like polls opening at 08:13 and closing at 16:13.
# The legal system finally switched to GMT when the Statutes (Definition
# of Time) Act took effect; it received the Royal Assent on 1880-08-02.
#
# In the tables below, we condense this complicated story into a single
# transition date for London, namely 1847-12-01.  We don't know as much
# about Dublin, so we use 1880-08-02, the legal transition time.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-19):
# The ancients had no need for daylight saving, as they kept time
# informally or via hours whose length depended on the time of year.
# Daylight saving time in its modern sense was invented by the
# New Zealand entomologist George Vernon Hudson (1867-1946),
# whose day job as a postal clerk led him to value
# after-hours daylight in which to pursue his research.
# In 1895 he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society
# that proposed a two-hour daylight-saving shift.  See:
# Hudson GV. On seasonal time-adjustment in countries south of lat. 30°.
# Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute. 1895;28:734
# http://rsnz.natlib.govt.nz/volume/rsnz_28/rsnz_28_00_006110.html
# Although some interest was expressed in New Zealand, his proposal
# did not find its way into law and eventually it was almost forgotten.
#
# In England, DST was independently reinvented by William Willett (1857-1915),
# a London builder and member of the Royal Astronomical Society
# who circulated a pamphlet "The Waste of Daylight" (1907)
# that proposed advancing clocks 20 minutes on each of four Sundays in April,
# and retarding them by the same amount on four Sundays in September.
# A bill was drafted in 1909 and introduced in Parliament several times,
# but it met with ridicule and opposition, especially from farming interests.
# Later editions of the pamphlet proposed one-hour summer time, and
# it was eventually adopted as a wartime measure in 1916.
# See: Summer Time Arrives Early, The Times (2000-05-18).
# A monument to Willett was unveiled on 1927-05-21, in an open space in
# a 45-acre wood near Chislehurst, Kent that was purchased by popular
# subscription and open to the public.  On the south face of the monolith,
# designed by G. W. Miller, is the William Willett Memorial Sundial,
# which is permanently set to Summer Time.

# From Winston Churchill (1934-04-28):
# It is one of the paradoxes of history that we should owe the boon of
# summer time, which gives every year to the people of this country
# between 160 and 170 hours more daylight leisure, to a war which
# plunged Europe into darkness for four years, and shook the
# foundations of civilization throughout the world.

# From Paul Eggert (2015-08-08):
# The OED Supplement says that the English originally said "Daylight Saving"
# when they were debating the adoption of DST in 1908; but by 1916 this
# term appears only in quotes taken from DST's opponents, whereas the
# proponents (who eventually won the argument) are quoted as using "Summer".
# The term "Summer Time" was introduced by Herbert Samuel, Home Secretary; see:
# Viscount Samuel. Leisure in a Democracy. Cambridge University Press
# ISBN 978-1-107-49471-8 (1949, reissued 2015), p 8.

# From Arthur David Olson (1989-01-19):
# A source at the British Information Office in New York avers that it's
# known as "British" Summer Time in all parts of the United Kingdom.

# Date: 4 Jan 89 08:57:25 GMT (Wed)
# From: Jonathan Leffler
# [British Summer Time] is fixed annually by Act of Parliament.
# If you can predict what Parliament will do, you should be in
# politics making a fortune, not computing.

# From Chris Carrier (1996-06-14):
# I remember reading in various wartime issues of the London Times the
# acronym BDST for British Double Summer Time.  Look for the published
# time of sunrise and sunset in The Times, when BDST was in effect, and
# if you find a zone reference it will say, "All times B.D.S.T."

# From Joseph S. Myers (1999-09-02):
# ... some military cables (WO 219/4100 - this is a copy from the
# main SHAEF archives held in the US National Archives, SHAEF/5252/8/516)
# agree that the usage is BDST (this appears in a message dated 17 Feb 1945).

# From Joseph S. Myers (2000-10-03):
# On 18th April 1941, Sir Stephen Tallents of the BBC wrote to Sir
# Alexander Maxwell of the Home Office asking whether there was any
# official designation; the reply of the 21st was that there wasn't
# but he couldn't think of anything better than the "Double British
# Summer Time" that the BBC had been using informally.
# https://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/bbc-19410418.png
# https://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/ho-19410421.png

# From Sir Alexander Maxwell in the above-mentioned letter (1941-04-21):
# [N]o official designation has as far as I know been adopted for the time
# which is to be introduced in May....
# I cannot think of anything better than "Double British Summer Time"
# which could not be said to run counter to any official description.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):
# Howse writes (p 157) 'DBST' too, but 'BDST' seems to have been common
# and follows the more usual convention of putting the location name first,
# so we use 'BDST'.

# Peter Ilieve (1998-04-19) described at length
# the history of summer time legislation in the United Kingdom.
# Since 1998 Joseph S. Myers has been updating
# and extending this list, which can be found in
# https://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/

# From Joseph S. Myers (1998-01-06):
#
# The legal time in the UK outside of summer time is definitely GMT, not UTC;
# see Lord Tanlaw's speech
# https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo970611/text/70611-10.htm#70611-10_head0
# (Lords Hansard 11 June 1997 columns 964 to 976).

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
#
# For lack of other data, follow Shanks & Pottenger for Eire in 1940-1948.
#
# Given Ilieve and Myers's data, the following claims by Shanks & Pottenger
# are incorrect:
#     * Wales did not switch from GMT to daylight saving time until
#	1921 Apr 3, when they began to conform with the rest of Great Britain.
# Actually, Wales was identical after 1880.
#     * Eire had two transitions on 1916 Oct 1.
# It actually just had one transition.
#     * Northern Ireland used single daylight saving time throughout WW II.
# Actually, it conformed to Britain.
#     * GB-Eire changed standard time to 1 hour ahead of GMT on 1968-02-18.
# Actually, that date saw the usual switch to summer time.
# Standard time was not changed until 1968-10-27 (the clocks didn't change).
#
# Here is another incorrect claim by Shanks & Pottenger:
#     * Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man did not switch from GMT
#	to daylight saving time until 1921 Apr 3, when they began to
#	conform with Great Britain.
# S.R.&O. 1916, No. 382 and HO 45/10811/312364 (quoted above) say otherwise.
#
# The following claim by Shanks & Pottenger is possible though doubtful;
# we'll ignore it for now.
#     * Dublin's 1971-10-31 switch was at 02:00, even though London's was 03:00.

# From Paul Eggert (2017-12-04):
#
# Dunsink Observatory (8 km NW of Dublin's center) was to Dublin as
# Greenwich was to London.  For example:
#
#   "Timeball on the ballast office is down.  Dunsink time."
#   -- James Joyce, Ulysses
#
# The abbreviation DMT stood for "Dublin Mean Time" or "Dunsink Mean Time";
# this being Ireland, opinions differed.
#
# Whitman says Dublin/Dunsink Mean Time was UT-00:25:21, which agrees
# with measurements of recent visitors to the Meridian Room of Dunsink
# Observatory; see Malone D. Dunsink and timekeeping. 2016-01-24.
# <https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwmalone/time/dunsink.html>.  Malone
# writes that the Nautical Almanac listed UT-00:25:22 until 1896, when
# it moved to UT-00:25:21.1 (I confirmed that the 1893 edition used
# the former and the 1896 edition used the latter).  Evidently the
# news of this change propagated slowly, as Milne 1899 still lists
# UT-00:25:22 and cites the International Telegraph Bureau.  As it is
# not clear that there was any practical significance to the change
# from UT-00:25:22 to UT-00:25:21.1 in civil timekeeping, omit this
# transition for now and just use the latter value.

# "Countess Markievicz ... claimed that the [1916] abolition of Dublin Mean Time
# was among various actions undertaken by the 'English' government that
# would 'put the whole country into the SF (Sinn Féin) camp'.  She claimed
# Irish 'public feeling (was) outraged by forcing of English time on us'."
# -- Parsons M. Dublin lost its time zone - and 25 minutes - after 1916 Rising.

# [These are all relative to the root, e.g., the first is
# <http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZA13Y1923.html>.]
#
# (These are those I found, but there could be more.  In any case these
# should allow various updates to the comments in the europe file to cover
# the laws applicable in Ireland.)
#
# (Note that the time in the Republic of Ireland since 1968 has been defined
# in terms of standard time being GMT+1 with a period of winter time when it
# is GMT, rather than standard time being GMT with a period of summer time
# being GMT+1.)

# From Paul Eggert (1999-03-28):
# Clive Feather (<news:859845706.26043.0@office.demon.net>, 1997-03-31)
# reports that Folkestone (Cheriton) Shuttle Terminal uses Concession Time
# (CT), equivalent to French civil time.
# Julian Hill (<news:36118128.5A14@virgin.net>, 1998-09-30) reports that
# trains between Dollands Moor (the freight facility next door)
# and Frethun run in CT.
# My admittedly uninformed guess is that the terminal has two authorities,
# the French concession operators and the British civil authorities,
# and that the time depends on who you're talking to.
# If, say, the British police were called to the station for some reason,
# I would expect the official police report to use GMT/BST and not CET/CEST.
# This is a borderline case, but for now let's stick to GMT/BST.

# From an anonymous contributor (1996-06-02):
# The law governing time in Ireland is under Statutory Instrument SI 395/94,
# which gives force to European Union 7th Council Directive No. 94/21/EC.
# Under this directive, the Minister for Justice in Ireland makes appropriate
# regulations. I spoke this morning with the Secretary of the Department of
# Justice (tel +353 1 678 9711) who confirmed to me that the correct name is
# "Irish Summer Time", abbreviated to "IST".
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-12-07):
# The 1996 anonymous contributor's goal was to determine the correct
# abbreviation for summer time in Dublin and so the contributor
# focused on the "IST", not on the "Irish Summer Time".  Though the
# "IST" was correct, the "Irish Summer Time" appears to have been an
# error, as Ireland's Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971 states that
# standard time in Ireland remains at UT +01 and is observed in
# summer, and that Greenwich mean time is observed in winter.  (Thanks
# to Derick Rethans for pointing out the error.)  That is, when
# Ireland amended the 1968 act that established UT +01 as Irish
# Standard Time, it left standard time unchanged and established GMT
# as a negative daylight saving time in winter.  So, in this database
# IST stands for Irish Summer Time for timestamps before 1968, and for
# Irish Standard Time after that.  See:

# From Paul Eggert (2018-02-15):
# In January 2018 we discovered that the negative SAVE values in the
# Eire rules cause problems with tests for ICU:
# https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2018-January/025825.html
# and with tests for OpenJDK:
# https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2018-January/025822.html
#
# To work around this problem, the build procedure can translate the
# following data into two forms, one with negative SAVE values and the
# other form with a traditional approximation for Irish timestamps
# after 1971-10-31 02:00 UTC; although this approximation has tm_isdst
# flags that are reversed, its UTC offsets are correct and this often
# suffices....
#
# The following is like GB-Eire and EU, except with standard time in
# summer and negative daylight saving time in winter.  It is for when
# negative SAVE values are used.

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2008-07-13):
#
# I found what is probably a typo of 2:00 which should perhaps be 2:00s
# in the C-Eur rule from tz database version 2008d (this part was
# corrected in version 2008d). The circumstantial evidence is simply the
# tz database itself, as seen below:
#
# Zone Europe/Paris ...
#    0:00 France WE%sT 1945 Sep 16  3:00
#
# Zone Europe/Monaco ...
#    0:00 France WE%sT 1945 Sep 16  3:00
#
# Zone Europe/Belgrade ...
#    1:00 1:00 CEST 1945 Sep 16  2:00s

# Rule France 1945 only - Sep 16  3:00 0 -
# Rule Belgium 1945 only - Sep 16  2:00s 0 -
# Rule Neth 1945 only - Sep 16 2:00s 0 -
#
# The rule line to be changed is:
#
# Rule C-Eur 1945 only - Sep 16  2:00 0 -
#
# It seems that Paris, Monaco, Rule France, Rule Belgium all agree on
# 2:00 standard time, e.g. 3:00 local time.  However there are no
# countries that use C-Eur rules in September 1945, so the only items
# affected are apparently these fictitious zones that translate acronyms
# CET and MET:
#
# Zone CET  1:00 C-Eur CE%sT
# Zone MET  1:00 C-Eur ME%sT
#
# It this is right then the corrected version would look like:

# Rule C-Eur 1945 only - Sep 16  2:00s 0 -

# Wikipedia and other sources refer to the Act of the Council of
# Ministers of the USSR from 1988-01-04 No. 5 and the Act of the
# Council of Ministers of the USSR from 1989-03-14 No. 227.
#
# I did not find full texts of these acts.  For the 1989 one we have
# title at https://base.garant.ru/70754136/ :
# "About change in calculation of time on the territories of
# Lithuanian SSR, Latvian SSR and Estonian SSR, Astrakhan,
# Kaliningrad, Kirov, Kuybyshev, Ulyanovsk and Uralsk oblasts".
# And http://astrozet.net/files/Zones/DOC/RU/1980-925.txt appears to
# contain quotes from both acts: Since last Sunday of March 1988 rules
# of the second time belt are installed in Volgograd and Saratov
# oblasts.  Since last Sunday of March 1989:
# a) Lithuanian SSR, Latvian SSR, Estonian SSR, Kaliningrad oblast:
# second time belt rules without extra hour (Moscow-1);
# b) Astrakhan, Kirov, Kuybyshev, Ulyanovsk oblasts: second time belt
# rules (Moscow time)
# c) Uralsk oblast: third time belt rules (Moscow+1).

# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-03-27):
# Unamended version of the act of the
# Government of the Russian Federation No. 23 from 08.01.1992
# http://pravo.gov.ru/proxy/ips/?docbody=&nd=102014034&rdk=0
# says that every year clocks were to be moved forward on last Sunday
# of March at 2 hours and moved backwards on last Sunday of September
# at 3 hours.  It was amended in 1996 to replace September with October.

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-06-14):
# According to Kremlin press service, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
# signed a federal law "On calculation of time" on June 9, 2011.
# According to the law Russia is abolishing daylight saving time.
#
# Medvedev signed a law "On the Calculation of Time" (in russian):
# http://bmockbe.ru/events/?ID=7583
#
# Medvedev signed a law on the calculation of the time (in russian):
# https://www.regnum.ru/news/polit/1413906.html

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-06-15):
# Take "abolishing daylight saving time" to mean that time is now considered
# to be standard.

# Previous editions of this database used abbreviations like MET DST
# for Central European Summer Time, but this didn't agree with common usage.

# From Markus Kuhn (1996-07-12):
# The official German names ... are
#
#	Mitteleuropäische Zeit (MEZ)         = UTC+01:00
#	Mitteleuropäische Sommerzeit (MESZ)  = UTC+02:00
#
# as defined in the German Time Act (Gesetz über die Zeitbestimmung (ZeitG),
# 1978-07-25, Bundesgesetzblatt, Jahrgang 1978, Teil I, S. 1110-1111)....
# I wrote ... to the German Federal Physical-Technical Institution
#
#	Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB)
#	Laboratorium 4.41 "Zeiteinheit"
#	Postfach 3345
#	D-38023 Braunschweig
#	phone: +49 531 592-0
#
# ... I received today an answer letter from Dr. Peter Hetzel, head of the PTB
# department for time and frequency transmission.  He explained that the
# PTB translates MEZ and MESZ into English as
#
#	Central European Time (CET)         = UTC+01:00
#	Central European Summer Time (CEST) = UTC+02:00

# The exposition in the web page
# https://www.bestor.be/wiki/index.php/Voyager_dans_le_temps._L%E2%80%99introduction_de_la_norme_de_Greenwich_en_Belgique
# gives several contemporary sources from which one can conclude that
# the switch in Europe/Brussels on 1892-05-01 was from 00:17:30 to 00:00:00.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2019-08-28):
# This quote helps explain the late-1914 situation:
#   In early November 1914, the Germans imposed the time zone used in central
#   Europe and forced the inhabitants to set their watches and public clocks
#   sixty minutes ahead.  Many were reluctant to accept "German time" and
#   continued to use "Belgian time" among themselves.  Reflecting the spirit of
#   resistance that arose in the population, a song made fun of this change....
# The song ended:
#   Putting your clock forward
#   Will but hasten the happy hour
#   When we kick out the Boches!

#
# From Ivan Benovic (2024-01-30):
# https://www.slov-lex.sk/pravne-predpisy/SK/ZZ/1946/54/
# (This is an official link to the Czechoslovak Summer Time Act of
# March 8, 1946 that authorizes the Czechoslovak government to set the
# exact dates of change to summer time and back to Central European Time.
# The act also implicitly confirms Central European Time as the

# https://www.psp.cz/eknih/1945pns/tisky/t0216_00.htm
# (This is a link to the original legislative proposal dating back to
# February 22, 1946. The accompanying memorandum to the proposal says

#
# From Paul Eggert (2024-01-30):
# The source for Czech data is: Kdy začíná a končí letní čas.
# https://kalendar.beda.cz/kdy-zacina-a-konci-letni-cas
# Its main text disagrees with its quoted sources only in 1918,

# whereas the 1918 source "Oznámení o zavedení letního času v roce 1918"
# says transitions were at 01:00 and 02:00 respectively.
# As the 1918 source appears to be a humorous piece, and it is
# unlikely that Prague would have disagreed with its neighbors by an hour,
# go with the main text for now.

# Greenland
#
# From Paul Eggert (2004-10-31):
# During World War II, Germany maintained secret manned weather stations in
# East Greenland and Franz Josef Land, but we don't know their time zones.
# My source for this is Wilhelm Dege's book mentioned under Svalbard.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-12-10):
# Greenland joined the European Communities as part of Denmark,
# obtained home rule on 1979-05-01, and left the European Communities
# on 1985-02-01.  It therefore should have been using EU
# rules at least through 1984.  Shanks & Pottenger say Scoresbysund and Godthåb
# used C-Eur rules after 1980, but IATA SSIM (1991/1996) says they use EU
# rules since at least 1991.  Assume EU rules since 1980.

# From Gwillim Law (2001-06-06), citing
# <http://www.statkart.no/efs/efshefter/2001/efs5-2001.pdf> (2001-03-15),
# and with translations corrected by Steffen Thorsen:
#
# Greenland has four local times, and the relation to UTC
# is according to the following time line:
#
# The military zone near Thule	UTC-4
# Standard Greenland time	UTC-3
# Scoresbysund			UTC-1
# Danmarkshavn			UTC
#
# In the military area near Thule and in Danmarkshavn DST will not be
# introduced.

# From Rives McDow (2001-11-01):
#
# I correspond regularly with the Dansk Polarcenter, and wrote them at
# the time to clarify the situation in Thule.  Unfortunately, I have
# not heard back from them regarding my recent letter.  [But I have
# info from earlier correspondence.]
#
# According to the center, a very small local time zone around Thule
# Air Base keeps the time according to UTC-4, implementing daylight
# savings using North America rules, changing the time at 02:00 local time....
#
# The east coast of Greenland north of the community of Scoresbysund
# uses UTC in the same way as in Iceland, year round, with no dst.
# There are just a few stations on this coast, including the
# Danmarkshavn ICAO weather station mentioned in your September 29th
# email.  The other stations are two sledge patrol stations in
# Mestersvig and Daneborg, the air force base at Station Nord, and the
# DPC research station at Zackenberg.
#
# Scoresbysund and two small villages nearby keep time UTC-1 and use
# the same daylight savings time period as in West Greenland (Godthåb).
#
# The rest of Greenland, including Godthåb (this area, although it
# includes central Greenland, is known as west Greenland), keeps time
# UTC-3, with daylight savings methods according to European rules.
#
# It is common procedure to use UTC 0 in the wilderness of East and
# North Greenland, because it is mainly Icelandic aircraft operators
# maintaining traffic in these areas.  However, the official status of
# this area is that it sticks with Godthåb time.  This area might be
# considered a dual time zone in some respects because of this.

# From Rives McDow (2001-11-19):
# I heard back from someone stationed at Thule; the time change took place
# there at 2:00 AM.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# From 1997 on the CIA map shows Danmarkshavn on GMT;
# the 1995 map as like Godthåb.
# For lack of better info, assume they were like Godthåb before 1996.
# startkart.no says Thule does not observe DST, but this is clearly an error,
# so go with Shanks & Pottenger for Thule transitions until this year.
# For 2007 on assume Thule will stay in sync with US DST rules.

# From J William Piggott (2016-02-20):
# "Greenland north of the community of Scoresbysund" is officially named
# "National Park" by Executive Order:
# http://naalakkersuisut.gl/~/media/Nanoq/Files/Attached%20Files/Engelske-tekster/Legislation/Executive%20Order%20National%20Park.rtf
# It is their only National Park.

# From Jonas Nyrup (2022-11-24):
# On last Saturday in October 2023 when DST ends America/Nuuk will switch
# from -03/-02 to -02/-01

# https://ina.gl/samlinger/oversigt-over-samlinger/samling/dagsordener/dagsorden.aspx?lang=da&day=24-11-2022
#
# From Thomas M. Steenholdt (2022-12-02):
# - The bill to move America/Nuuk from UTC-03 to UTC-02 passed.
# - The bill to stop observing DST did not (Greenland will stop observing DST
#   when EU does).
# Details on the implementation are here (section 6):
# https://ina.gl/dvd/EM%202022/pdf/media/2553529/pkt17_em2022_tidens_bestemmelse_bem_da.pdf
# This is how the change will be implemented:
# 1. The shift *to* DST in 2023 happens as normal.
# 2. The shift *from* DST in 2023 happens as normal, but coincides with the
#    shift to UTC-02 normaltime (people will not change their clocks here).
# 3. After this, DST is still observed, but as -02/-01 instead of -03/-02.
#
# From Múte Bourup Egede via Jógvan Svabo Samuelsen (2023-03-15):
# Greenland will not switch to Daylight Saving Time this year, 2023,
# because the standard time for Greenland will change from UTC -3 to UTC -2.
# However, Greenland will change to Daylight Saving Time again in 2024
# and onwards.

# From Jule Dabars (2023-10-29):
# https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/seneste/i-nat-skal-uret-stilles-en-time-tilbage-men-foerste-gang-sker-det-ikke-i-groenland
# with a link to that page:
# https://naalakkersuisut.gl/Nyheder/2023/10/2710_sommertid
# ... Ittoqqortoormiit joins the time of Nuuk at March 2024.
# What would mean that America/Scoresbysund would either be in -01 year round
# or in -02/-01 like America/Nuuk, but no longer in -01/+00.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2023-10-29):
# For now, assume it will be like America/Nuuk.

# Estonia
#
# From Paul Eggert (2016-03-18):
# The 1989 transition is from USSR act No. 227 (1989-03-14).
#
# From Peter Ilieve (1994-10-15):
# A relative in Tallinn confirms the accuracy of the data for 1989 onwards
# [through 1994] and gives the legal authority for it,
# a regulation of the Government of Estonia, No. 111 of 1989....
#
# From Peter Ilieve (1996-10-28):
# [IATA SSIM (1992/1996) claims that the Baltic republics switch at 01:00s,
# but a relative confirms that Estonia still switches at 02:00s, writing:]
# "I do not [know] exactly but there are some little different
# (confusing) rules for International Air and Railway Transport Schedules
# conversion in Sunday connected with end of summer time in Estonia....
# A discussion is running about the summer time efficiency and effect on
# human physiology.  It seems that Estonia maybe will not change to
# summer time next spring."

# From Peter Ilieve (1998-11-04), heavily edited:
# The 1998-09-22 Estonian time law
# http://trip.rk.ee/cgi-bin/thw?${BASE}=akt&${OOHTML}=rtd&TA=1998&TO=1&AN=1390
# refers to the Eighth Directive and cites the association agreement between
# the EU and Estonia, ratified by the Estonian law (RT II 1995, 22-27, 120).
#
# I also asked [my relative] whether they use any standard abbreviation
# for their standard and summer times. He says no, they use "suveaeg"
# (summer time) and "talveaeg" (winter time).

# From The Baltic Times <https://www.baltictimes.com/> (1999-09-09)
# via Steffen Thorsen:
# This year will mark the last time Estonia shifts to summer time,
# a council of the ruling coalition announced Sept. 6....
# But what this could mean for Estonia's chances of joining the European
# Union are still unclear.  In 1994, the EU declared summer time compulsory
# for all member states until 2001.  Brussels has yet to decide what to do
# after that.

# From Mart Oruaas (2000-01-29):
# Regulation No. 301 (1999-10-12) obsoletes previous regulation
# No. 206 (1998-09-22) and thus sticks Estonia to +02:00 GMT for all
# the year round.  The regulation is effective 1999-11-01.

# From Toomas Soome (2002-02-21):
# The Estonian government has changed once again timezone politics.
# Now we are using again EU rules.
#
# From Urmet Jänes (2002-03-28):
# The legislative reference is Government decree No. 84 on 2002-02-21.

# I noticed that the Finland data is not accurate for years 1981 and 1982.
# During these two first trial years the DST adjustment was made one hour
# earlier than in forthcoming years. Starting 1983 the adjustment was made
# according to the central European standards.
#
# This is documented in Heikki Oja: Aikakirja 2007, published by The Almanac
# Office of University of Helsinki, ISBN 952-10-3221-9, available online (in
# Finnish) at
# https://almanakka.helsinki.fi/aikakirja/Aikakirja2007kokonaan.pdf
#
# Page 105 (56 in PDF version) has a handy table of all past daylight savings
# transitions. It is easy enough to interpret without Finnish skills.
#
# This is also confirmed by Finnish Broadcasting Company's archive at:
# http://www.yle.fi/elavaarkisto/?s=s&g=1&ag=5&t=&a=3401
#
# The news clip from 1981 says that "the time between 2 and 3 o'clock does not
# exist tonight."

# https://almanakka.helsinki.fi/images/aikakirja/Aikakirja2013kokonaan.pdf
# pages 104-105, including a scan from a newspaper published on Apr 2 1942
# say that ... [o]n Apr 2 1942, 24 o'clock (which means Apr 3 1942,
# 00:00), clocks were moved one hour forward. The newspaper

# On Oct 4 1942, clocks were moved at 1:00 one hour backwards.

# From Michael Deckers (2020-06-11):
# the law of 1891 <https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k64415343.texteImage>
# was published on 1891-03-15, so it could only take force on 1891-03-16.

# From Michael Deckers (2020-06-10):
# Le Gaulois, 1911-03-11, page 1/6, online at
# https://www.retronews.fr/societe/echo-de-presse/2018/01/29/1911-change-lheure-de-paris
# ... [ Instantly, all pressure driven clock dials halted...  Nine minutes and
#       twenty-one seconds later the hands resumed their circular motion. ]
# There are also precise reports about how the change was prepared in train
# stations: all the publicly visible clocks stopped at midnight railway time
# (or were covered), only the chief of service had a watch, labeled
# "Heure ancienne", that he kept running until it reached 00:04:21, when
# he announced "Heure nouvelle".  See the "Le Petit Journal 1911-03-11".
# https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6192911/f1.item.zoom
#
# From Michael Deckers (2020-06-12):
# That "all French clocks stopped" for 00:09:21 is a misreading of French
# newspapers; this sort of adjustment applies only to certain
# remote-controlled clocks ("pendules pneumatiques", of which there existed
# perhaps a dozen in Paris, and which simply could not be set back remotely),
# but not to all the clocks in all French towns and villages.  For instance,
# the following story in the "Courrier de Saône-et-Loire" 1911-03-11, page 2:
# only works if legal time was stepped back (was not monotone): ...
#   [One can observe that children who had been born at midnight less 5
#    minutes and who had died at midnight of the old time, would turn out to
#    be dead before being born, time having been set back and having
#    suppressed 9 minutes and 25 seconds of their existence, that is, more
#    than they could spend.]
#
# From Paul Eggert (2020-06-12):
# French time in railway stations was legally five minutes behind civil time,
# which explains why railway "old time" ran to 00:04:21 instead of to 00:09:21.
# The law's text (which Michael Deckers noted is at
# <https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2022333z/f2>) says only that
# at 1911-03-11 00:00 legal time was that of Paris mean time delayed by
# nine minutes and twenty-one seconds, and does not say how the
# transition from Paris mean time was to occur.
#
# tzdb has no way to represent stopped clocks.  As the railway practice
# was to keep a watch running on "old time" to decide when to restart
# the other clocks, this could be modeled as a transition for "old time" at
# 00:09:21.  However, since the law was ambiguous and clocks outside railway
# stations were probably done haphazardly with the popular impression being
# that the transition was done at 00:00 "old time", simply leave the time
# blank; this causes zic to default to 00:00 "old time" which is good enough.
# Do something similar for the 1891-03-16 transition.  There are similar
# problems in Algiers, Monaco and Tunis.

#
# Shank & Pottenger seem to use '24:00' ambiguously; resolve it with Whitman.

# From Markus Kuhn (1998-09-29):

# Bundesanstalt contains DST information back to 1916.
# [See tz-link.html for the URL.]

# From Jörg Schilling (2002-10-23):
# In 1945, Berlin was switched to Moscow Summer time (GMT+4) by
# https://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/biografien/BersarinNikolai/

# says that Bersarin issued an order to use Moscow time on May 20.
# However, Moscow did not observe daylight saving in 1945, so
# this was equivalent to UT +03, not +04.

# Svalbard & Jan Mayen

# From Steffen Thorsen (2001-05-01):
# Although I could not find it explicitly, it seems that Jan Mayen and
# Svalbard have been using the same time as Norway at least since the
# time they were declared as parts of Norway.  Svalbard was declared
# as a part of Norway by law of 1925-07-17 no 11, section 4 and Jan
# Mayen by law of 1930-02-27 no 2, section 2. (From
# <http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-19250717-011.html> and
# <http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-19300227-002.html>).  The law/regulation
# for normal/standard time in Norway is from 1894-06-29 no 1 (came
# into operation on 1895-01-01) and Svalbard/Jan Mayen seem to be a
# part of this law since 1925/1930. (From
# <http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-18940629-001.html>) I have not been
# able to find if Jan Mayen used a different time zone (e.g. -0100)
# before 1930. Jan Mayen has only been "inhabited" since 1921 by
# Norwegian meteorologists and maybe used the same time as Norway ever
# since 1921.  Svalbard (Arctic/Longyearbyen) has been inhabited since
# before 1895, and therefore probably changed the local time somewhere
# between 1895 and 1925 (inclusive).

# From Paul Eggert (2013-09-04):
#
# Actually, Jan Mayen was never occupied by Germany during World War II,
# so it must have diverged from Oslo time during the war, as Oslo was
# keeping Berlin time.
#
# <https://www.jan-mayen.no/history.htm> says that the meteorologists
# burned down their station in 1940 and left the island, but returned in
# 1941 with a small Norwegian garrison and continued operations despite
# frequent air attacks from Germans.  In 1943 the Americans established a
# radiolocating station on the island, called "Atlantic City".  Possibly
# the UT offset changed during the war, but I think it unlikely that
# Jan Mayen used German daylight-saving rules.
#
# Svalbard is more complicated, as it was raided in August 1941 by an
# Allied party that evacuated the civilian population to England (says
# <http://www.bartleby.com/65/sv/Svalbard.html>).  The Svalbard FAQ
# <http://www.svalbard.com/SvalbardFAQ.html> says that the Germans were
# expelled on 1942-05-14.  However, small parties of Germans did return,
# and according to Wilhelm Dege's book "War North of 80" (1954)
# http://www.ucalgary.ca/UofC/departments/UP/1-55238/1-55238-110-2.html
# the German armed forces at the Svalbard weather station code-named
# Haudegen did not surrender to the Allies until September 1945.
#
# All these events predate our cutoff date of 1970, so use Europe/Berlin
# for these regions.

# Italy
# San Marino
# Vatican City
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
# Sicily and Sardinia each had their own time zones from 1866 to 1893,
# called Palermo Time (+00:53:28) and Cagliari Time (+00:36:32).
# During World War II, German-controlled Italy used German time.
# But these events all occurred before the 1970 cutoff,
# so record only the time in Rome.
#
# From Stephen Trainor (2019-05-06):
# http://www.ac-ilsestante.it/MERIDIANE/ora_legale/ORA_LEGALE_ESTIVA_IN_ITALIA.htm
# ... the [1866] law went into effect on 12 December 1866, rather than
# the date of the decree (22 Sep 1866)
# https://web.archive.org/web/20070824155341/http://www.iav.it/planetario/didastro/didastro/english.htm
# ... "In Italy in 1866 there were 6 railway times (Torino, Verona, Firenze,
# Roma, Napoli, Palermo). On that year it was decided to unify them, adopting
# the average time of Rome (even if this city was not yet part of the
# kingdom).  On the 12th December 1866, on the starting of the winter time
# table, it took effect in the railways, the post office and the telegraph,
# not only for the internal service but also for the public....  Milano set
# the public watches on the Rome time on the same day (12th December 1866),
# Torino and Bologna on the 1st January 1867, Venezia the 1st May 1880 and the
# last city was Cagliari in 1886."
#
# From Luigi Rosa (2019-05-07):
# this is the scan of the decree:
# http://www.radiomarconi.com/marconi/filopanti/1866c.jpg
#
# From Michael Deckers (2016-10-24):
# http://www.ac-ilsestante.it/MERIDIANE/ora_legale quotes a law of 1893-08-10
# ... [translated as] "The preceding dispositions will enter into
# force at the instant at which, according to the time specified in
# the 1st article, the 1st of November 1893 will begin...."
#
# From Pierpaolo Bernardi (2016-10-20):
# The authoritative source for time in Italy is the national metrological
# institute, which has a summary page of historical DST data at
# http://www.inrim.it/res/tf/ora_legale_i.shtml
# [now at http://oldsite.inrim.it/res/tf/ora_legale_i.shtml as of 2017]
# (2016-10-24):
# http://www.renzobaldini.it/le-ore-legali-in-italia/
# has still different data for 1944.  It divides Italy in two, as
# there were effectively two governments at the time, north of Gothic
# Line German controlled territory, official government RSI, and south
# of the Gothic Line, controlled by allied armies.
#
# From Brian Inglis (2016-10-23):
# Viceregal LEGISLATIVE DECREE. 14 September 1944, no. 219.
# Restoration of Standard Time. (044U0219) (OJ 62 of 30.9.1944) ...
# Given the R. law decreed on 1944-03-29, no. 92, by which standard time is
# advanced to sixty minutes later starting at hour two on 1944-04-02; ...
# Starting at hour three on the date 1944-09-17 standard time will be resumed.
#
# From Alois Treindl (2019-07-02):
# I spent 6 Euros to buy two archive copies of Il Messaggero, a Roman paper,
# for 1 and 2 April 1944.  The edition of 2 April has this note: "Tonight at 2
# am, put forward the clock by one hour.  Remember that in the night between
# today and Monday the 'ora legale' will come in force again."  That makes it
# clear that in Rome the change was on Monday, 3 April 1944 at 2 am.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2021-10-05):
# Go with INRiM for DST rules, except as corrected by Inglis for 1944
# for the Kingdom of Italy.  This is consistent with Renzo Baldini.
# Model Rome's occupation by using C-Eur rules from 1943-09-10
# to 1944-06-04; although Rome was an open city during this period, it
# was effectively controlled by Germany.  Using C-Eur is consistent
# with Treindl's comment about Rome in April 1944, as the "Rule Italy"
# lines during German occupation do not affect Europe/Rome
# (though they do affect Europe/Malta).

# Latvia

# From Liene Kanepe (1998-09-17):

# I asked about this matter Scientific Secretary of the Institute of Astronomy
# of The University of Latvia Dr. paed Mr. Ilgonis Vilks. I also searched the
# correct data in juridical acts and I found some juridical documents about
# changes in the counting of time in Latvia from 1981....
#
# Act No. 35 of the Council of Ministers of Latvian SSR of 1981-01-22 ...
# according to the Act No. 925 of the Council of Ministers of USSR of 1980-10-24
# ...: all year round the time of 2nd time zone + 1 hour, in addition turning
# the hands of the clock 1 hour forward on 1 April at 00:00 (GMT 31 March 21:00)
# and 1 hour backward on the 1 October at 00:00 (GMT 30 September 20:00).
#
# Act No. 592 of the Council of Ministers of Latvian SSR of 1984-09-24 ...
# according to the Act No. 967 of the Council of Ministers of USSR of 1984-09-13
# ...: all year round the time of 2nd time zone + 1 hour, in addition turning
# the hands of the clock 1 hour forward on the last Sunday of March at 02:00
# (GMT 23:00 on the previous day) and 1 hour backward on the last Sunday of
# September at 03:00 (GMT 23:00 on the previous day).
#
# Act No. 81 of the Council of Ministers of Latvian SSR of 1989-03-22 ...
# according to the Act No. 227 of the Council of Ministers of USSR of 1989-03-14
# ...: since the last Sunday of March 1989 in Lithuanian SSR, Latvian SSR,
# Estonian SSR and Kaliningrad region of Russian Federation all year round the
# time of 2nd time zone (Moscow time minus one hour). On the territory of Latvia
# transition to summer time is performed on the last Sunday of March at 02:00
# (GMT 00:00), turning the hands of the clock 1 hour forward.  The end of
# daylight saving time is performed on the last Sunday of September at 03:00
# (GMT 00:00), turning the hands of the clock 1 hour backward. Exception is
# 1989-03-26, when we must not turn the hands of the clock....
#
# The Regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia of
# 1997-01-21 on transition to Summer time ... established the same order of
# daylight savings time settings as in the States of the European Union.

# From Andrei Ivanov (2000-03-06):
# This year Latvia will not switch to Daylight Savings Time (as specified in
# The Regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Rep. of Latvia of
# 29-Feb-2000 (No. 79) <http://www.lv-laiks.lv/wwwraksti/2000/071072/vd4.htm>,
# in Latvian for subscribers only).

# From RFE/RL Newsline
# http://www.rferl.org/newsline/2001/01/3-CEE/cee-030101.html
# (2001-01-03), noted after a heads-up by Rives McDow:
# The Latvian government on 2 January decided that the country will
# institute daylight-saving time this spring, LETA reported.
# Last February the three Baltic states decided not to turn back their
# clocks one hour in the spring....
# Minister of Economy Aigars Kalvītis noted that Latvia had too few
# daylight hours and thus decided to comply with a draft European
# Commission directive that provides for instituting daylight-saving
# time in EU countries between 2002 and 2006. The Latvian government
# urged Lithuania and Estonia to adopt a similar time policy, but it
# appears that they will not do so....

# Lithuania

# From Paul Eggert (2016-03-18):
# The 1989 transition is from USSR act No. 227 (1989-03-14).

# From Paul Eggert (1996-11-22):
# IATA SSIM (1992/1996) says Lithuania uses W-Eur rules, but since it is
# known to be wrong about Estonia and Latvia, assume it's wrong here too.

# From Marius Gedminas (1998-08-07):
# I would like to inform that in this year Lithuanian time zone
# (Europe/Vilnius) was changed.

# From ELTA No. 972 (2582) (1999-09-29) <http://www.elta.lt/>,
# via Steffen Thorsen:
# Lithuania has shifted back to the second time zone (GMT plus two hours)
# to be valid here starting from October 31,
# as decided by the national government on Wednesday....
# The Lithuanian government also announced plans to consider a
# motion to give up shifting to summer time in spring, as it was
# already done by Estonia.

# From the Fact File, Lithuanian State Department of Tourism
# <http://www.tourism.lt/informa/ff.htm> (2000-03-27):
# Local time is GMT+2 hours ..., no daylight saving.

# From a user via Klaus Marten (2003-02-07):
# As a candidate for membership of the European Union, Lithuania will
# observe Summer Time in 2003, changing its clocks at the times laid

# Moldova

# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-03-07):
# the act of the government of the Republic of Moldova Nr. 132 from 1990-05-04
# http://lex.justice.md/viewdoc.php?action=view&view=doc&id=298782&lang=2
# ... says that since 1990-05-06 on the territory of the Moldavian SSR
# time would be calculated as the standard time of the second time belt
# plus one hour of the "summer" time. To implement that clocks would be
# adjusted one hour backwards at 1990-05-06 2:00. After that "summer"
# time would be cancelled last Sunday of September at 3:00 and
# reintroduced last Sunday of March at 2:00.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# A previous version of this database followed Shanks & Pottenger, who write
# that Tiraspol switched to Moscow time on 1992-01-19 at 02:00.
# However, this is most likely an error, as Moldova declared independence
# on 1991-08-27 (the 1992-01-19 date is that of a Russian decree).
# In early 1992 there was large-scale interethnic violence in the area
# and it's possible that some Russophones continued to observe Moscow time.
# But [two people] separately reported via
# Jesper Nørgaard that as of 2001-01-24 Tiraspol was like Chisinau.
# The Tiraspol entry has therefore been removed for now.
#
# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-10-17):
# Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR, also known as
# "Pridnestrovie") has abolished seasonal clock change (no transition
# to the Winter Time).
#
# News (in Russian):
# http://www.kyivpost.ua/russia/news/pridnestrove-otkazalos-ot-perehoda-na-zimnee-vremya-30954.html
# http://www.allmoldova.com/moldova-news/1249064116.html
#
# The substance of this change (reinstatement of the Tiraspol entry)
# is from a patch from Petr Machata (2011-10-17)
#
# From Tim Parenti (2011-10-19)
# In addition, being situated at +4651+2938 would give Tiraspol
# a pre-1880 LMT offset of 1:58:32.
#
# (which agrees with the earlier entry that had been removed)
#
# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-10-26)
# NO need to divide Moldova into two timezones at this point.
# As of today, Transnistria (Pridnestrovie)- Tiraspol reversed its own
# decision to abolish DST this winter.
# Following Moldova and neighboring Ukraine- Transnistria (Pridnestrovie)-
# Tiraspol will go back to winter time on October 30, 2011.
# News from Moldova (in russian):

# From Roman Tudos (2015-07-02):

# From Paul Eggert (2015-07-01):
# The abovementioned official link to IGO1445-868/2014 states that

# Portugal

# From Tim Parenti (2024-07-01), per Alois Treindl (2021-02-07) and Michael
# Deckers (2021-02-10):
# http://oal.ul.pt/documentos/2018/01/hl1911a2018.pdf/
# The Astronomical Observatory of Lisbon has published a list detailing the
# historical transitions in legal time within continental Portugal.  It
# directly references many decrees and ordinances which are, in turn,
# referenced below.  They can be viewed in the public archives of the Diário da
# República (until 1976-04-09 known as the Diário do Govêrno) at
# https://dre.pt/ (in Portuguese).
#
# Most of the Rules below have been updated simply to match the Observatory's
# listing for continental (mainland) Portugal.  Although there are over 50
# referenced decrees and ordinances, only the handful with comments below have
# been verified against the text, typically to provide additional confidence
# wherever dates provided by Whitman and Shanks & Pottenger had disagreed.
# See further below for the Azores and Madeira.

# From Tim Parenti (2024-07-01), per Paul Eggert (2014-08-11), after a
# heads-up from Stephen Colebourne:
# According to a 1911-05-24 Portuguese decree, Lisbon was at -0:36:44.68, but
# switched to GMT on 1912-01-01 at 00:00.
# https://dre.pt/dr/detalhe/decreto/593090
# https://dre.pt/application/conteudo/593090
# The decree made legal time throughout Portugal and her possessions
# "subordinate to the Greenwich meridian, according to the principle adopted at
# the Washington Convention in 1884" and eliminated the "difference of five
# minutes between the internal and external clocks of railway stations".
#
# The decree was gazetted in the 1911-05-30 issue of Diário do Govêrno, and is
# considered to be dated 1911-05-24 by that issue's summary; however, the text
# of the decree itself is dated 1911-05-26.  The Diário da República website
# notes the discrepancy, but later laws and the Observatory all seem to refer
# to this decree by the 1911-05-24 date.
#
# From Michael Deckers (2018-02-15):
# article 5 [of the 1911 decree; Deckers's translation] ...:
# These dispositions shall enter into force at the instant at which,
# according to the 2nd article, the civil day January 1, 1912 begins,
# all clocks therefore having to be advanced or set back correspondingly ...

# Rule	NAME	FROM	TO	-	IN	ON	AT	SAVE	LETTER/S
# From Tim Parenti (2024-07-01), per Paul Eggert (1999-01-30):
# DSH writes in their history that Decreto 1469 of 1915-03-30 established
# summer time and that, "despite" this, the change to the clocks was not done
# every year, depending on what Spain did, because of railroad schedules.
# In fact, that decree had nothing to do with DST; rather, it regulated the
# sending of time signals.  But we do see linkage to Spain in the 1920s below.
# https://dre.pt/dr/detalhe/decreto/1469-1915-285721
# https://dre.pt/application/conteudo/285721
#
# According to the Observatory, standard time was first advanced by Decreto
# 2433 of 1916-06-09 and restored by Decreto 2712 of 1916-10-28.  While Whitman
# gives 1916-10-31 for the latter transition, Shanks & Pottenger agrees more
# closely with the decree, which stated that its provision "will start sixty
# minutes after the end of 31 October, according to the current time," i.e.,
# 01:00 on 1 November.

# 3446 of 1917-10-11 changed the annual end date to 14 October.

# considered "that the absence of similar measures would cause serious
# difficulties for international rail connections with consequent repercussions
# on domestic service hours..." along with "inconvenient analogues...for postal

# From Tim Parenti (2024-07-01), per Alois Treindl (2021-02-07):
# The Astronomical Observatory of Lisbon cites Portaria 11767 of 1947-03-28 for

# https://dre.pt/dr/detalhe/portaria/12286-1948-152953
# https://dre.pt/application/conteudo/152953
#
# Although the latter ordinance explicitly had the 1948-10-03 transition
# scheduled for 02:00 rather than 03:00 as had been used in 1947, Decreto-Lei
# 37048 of 1948-09-07 recognized "that it is advisable to definitely set...the

# https://dre.pt/dr/detalhe/decreto-lei/37048-1948-373810
# https://dre.pt/application/conteudo/373810
# While the Observatory only cites this act for 1949-1965 and not for 1948, it
# does not appear to have had any provision delaying its effect, so assume that
# it overrode the prior ordinance for 1948-10-03.
#
# Whitman says DST was not observed in 1950 and gives Oct lastSun for 1952 on.

# From Tim Parenti (2024-07-01):
# Decreto-Lei 47233 of 1966-10-01 considered that the "duality" in time was
# "the cause of serious disturbances" and noted that "the countries with which
# we have the most frequent contacts...have already adopted" a solution
# coinciding with the extant "summer time".  It established that the former
# "summer time" would apply year-round on the mainland and adjacent islands
# with immediate effect, as the fall back would have otherwise occurred later
# that evening.
# https://dre.pt/dr/detalhe/decreto-lei/47233-1966-293729
# Model this by changing zones without changing clocks at the

#
# Decreto-Lei 309/76 of 1976-04-27 acknowledged that those international
# contacts had returned to adopting seasonal times, and considered that the
# year-round advancement "entails considerable sacrifices for the vast majority
# of the working population during the winter months", including morning
# visibility concerns for schoolchildren.  It specified, beginning 1976-09-26
# 01:00, an annual return to UT+00 on the mainland from 00:00 UT on Sep lastSun
# to 00:00 UT on Mar lastSun (unless the latter date fell on Easter, in which
# case it was to be brought forward to the preceding Sunday).  It also assigned
# the Permanent Time Commission to study and propose revisions for the Azores
# and Madeira, neither of which resumed DST until 1982 (as described further

# (Transitions of 1:00s as previously reported and used by the W-Eur rules,

# difference" by shifting the Azores forward as well from 1992-12-27.  Just six
# months later, this was revoked by Decreto Legislativo Regional 9/93/A, citing
# "major changes in work habits and way of life."  Though the revocation didn't
# give a transition time, it was signed Wednesday 1993-06-16; assume it took
# effect later that evening, and that an EU-style spring forward (to +01) was
# still observed in the interim on 1993-03-28.

# Decreto Regional 5/82/M, published 1982-04-03, established DST transitions at
# 0:00u, which for Madeira is equivalent to the mainland's rules (0:00s) at the

# (Government document
# http://www.government.ru/gov/results/16355/print/

# They are in Cyrillic letters (presumably Russian).

# From Arthur David Olson (2012-05-09):
# Regarding the instant when clocks in time-zone-shifting parts of Russia
# changed in September 2011:
#
# One source is
# http://government.ru/gov/results/16355/
# which, according to translate.google.com, begins "Decree of August 31,
# 2011 No. 725" and contains no other dates or "effective date" information.
#
# Another source is
# https://rg.ru/2011/09/06/chas-zona-dok.html
# which, according to translate.google.com, begins "Resolution of the
# Government of the Russian Federation on August 31, 2011 N 725" and also
# contains "Date first official publication: September 6, 2011 Posted on:
# in the 'RG' - Federal Issue No. 5573 September 6, 2011" but which
# does not contain any "effective date" information.
#
# Another source is
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oymyakonsky_District#cite_note-RuTime-7
# which, in note 8, contains "Resolution No. 725 of August 31, 2011...
# Effective as of after 7 days following the day of the official publication"
# but which does not contain any reference to September 6, 2011.
#
# The Wikipedia article refers to
# http://base.consultant.ru/cons/cgi/online.cgi?req=doc;base=LAW;n=118896
# which seems to copy the text of the government.ru page.
#
# Tobias Conradi combines Wikipedia's

# Moscow time zone abbreviations after 1919-07-01, and Moscow rules after 1991,
# are from Andrey A. Chernov.  The rest is from Shanks & Pottenger,
# except we follow Chernov's report that 1992 DST transitions were Sat
# 23:00, not Sun 02:00s.
#
# From Stanislaw A. Kuzikowski (1994-06-29):
# But now it is some months since Novosibirsk is 3 hours ahead of Moscow!
# I do not know why they have decided to make this change;
# as far as I remember it was done exactly during winter->summer switching
# so we (Novosibirsk) simply did not switch.
#
# From Andrey A. Chernov (1996-10-04):
# 'MSK' and 'MSD' were born and used initially on Moscow computers with
# UNIX-like OSes by several developer groups (e.g. Demos group, Kiae group)....
# The next step was the UUCP network, the Relcom predecessor
# (used mainly for mail), and MSK/MSD was actively used there.
#
# From Chris Carrier (1996-10-30):
# According to a friend of mine who rode the Trans-Siberian Railroad from
# Moscow to Irkutsk in 1995, public air and rail transport in Russia ...
# still follows Moscow time, no matter where in Russia it is located.
#
# For Grozny, Chechnya, we have the following story from
# John Daniszewski, "Scavengers in the Rubble", Los Angeles Times (2001-02-07):
# News - often false - is spread by word of mouth.  A rumor that it was
# time to move the clocks back put this whole city out of sync with
# the rest of Russia for two weeks - even soldiers stationed here began
# enforcing curfew at the wrong time.
#
# From Gwillim Law (2001-06-05):
# There's considerable evidence that Sakhalin Island used to be in
# UTC+11, and has changed to UTC+10, in this decade.  I start with the
# SSIM, which listed Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in zone RU10 along with Magadan
# until February 1997, and then in RU9 with Khabarovsk and Vladivostok
# since September 1997....  Although the Kuril Islands are
# administratively part of Sakhalin oblast', they appear to have
# remained on UTC+11 along with Magadan.

# From Paul Eggert (2018-07-16):
# Perhaps someone could translate the above-mentioned link and use it
# to correct our data for the ex-Soviet Union.  It cites the following:

# приборов при Совете Министров СССР, Междуведомственная комиссия

# This book looks like it would be a helpful resource for the Soviet
# Union through 1956.  Although a copy was in the Scientific Library
# of Tomsk State University, I have not been able to track down a copy nearby.

# http://astro.uni-altai.ru/~orion/blog/2015/05/center-reforma-ischisleniya-vremeni-br-na-territorii-sssr-v-1957-godu-center/
# says that the 1956 decision to change time belts' borders was not
# implemented as planned in 1956 and the change happened in 1957.
# There is also the problem that actual time zones were different from
# the official time belts (and from many time belts' maps) as there were
# numerous exceptions to application of time belt rules.  For example,
# https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Московское_время#Перемещение_границы_применения_московского_времени_на_восток
# says that by 1962 there were many regions in the 3rd time belt that
# were on Moscow time, referring to a 1962 map.  By 1989 number of such
# exceptions grew considerably.

# From Tim Parenti (2014-07-06):
# The comments detailing the coverage of each Russian zone are meant to assist
# with maintenance only and represent our best guesses as to which regions
# are covered by each zone.  They are not meant to be taken as an authoritative
# listing.  The region codes listed come from
# https://en.wikipedia.org/w/?title=Federal_subjects_of_Russia&oldid=611810498

# From Paul Eggert (2019-07-25):
# Although Shanks lists 1945-01-01 as the date for transition from
# +01/+02 to +02/+03, more likely this is a placeholder.  Guess that
# the transition occurred at 1945-04-10 00:00, which is about when
# Königsberg surrendered to Soviet troops.  (Thanks to Alois Treindl.)

# From Paul Eggert (2016-03-18):
# The 1989 transition is from USSR act No. 227 (1989-03-14).

# http://www.rgo.ru/ru/kaliningradskoe-oblastnoe-otdelenie/ob-otdelenii/publikacii/kak-nam-zhilos-bez-letnego-vremeni
# confirms that the 1989 change to Moscow-1 was implemented.
# (The article, though, is misattributed to 1990 while saying that
# summer->winter transition would be done on the 24 of September. But
# 1990-09-24 was Monday, while 1989-09-24 was Sunday as expected.)
# ...
# http://www.kaliningradka.ru/site_pc/cherez/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=40091

# (Thanks to Alexander Belopolsky for pointers to the decrees.)

# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-03-07):
# 11. Regions-violators, 1981-1982.
# Wikipedia refers to
# http://maps.monetonos.ru/maps/raznoe/Old_Maps/Old_Maps/Articles/022/3_1981.html
# http://besp.narod.ru/nauka_1981_3.htm
#
# The second link provides two articles scanned from the Nauka i Zhizn
# magazine No. 3, 1981 and a scan of the short article attributed to
# the Trud newspaper from February 1982.  The first link provides the
# same Nauka i Zhizn articles converted to the text form (but misses
# time belt changes map).
#
# The second Nauka i Zhizn article says that in addition to
# introduction of summer time on 1981-04-01 there are some time belt
# border changes on 1981-10-01, mostly affecting Nenets Autonomous
# Okrug, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Yakutia, Magadan Oblast and Chukotka
# according to the provided map (colored one).  In addition to that
# "time violators" (regions which were not using rules of the time
# belts in which they were located) would not be moving off the DST on
# 1981-10-01 to restore the decree time usage.  (Komi ASSR was
# supposed to repeat that move in October 1982 to account for the 2
# hour difference.)  Map depicting "time violators" before 1981-10-01
# is also provided.
#
# The article from Trud says that 1981-10-01 changes caused problems
# and some territories would be moved to pre-1981-10-01 time by not
# moving to summer time on 1982-04-01.  Namely: Dagestan,
# Kabardino-Balkar, Kalmyk, Komi, Mari, Mordovian, North Ossetian,
# Tatar, Chechen-Ingush and Chuvash ASSR, Krasnodar and Stavropol
# krais, Arkhangelsk, Vladimir, Vologda, Voronezh, Gorky, Ivanovo,
# Kostroma, Lipetsk, Penza, Rostov, Ryazan, Tambov, Tyumen and
# Yaroslavl oblasts, Nenets and Evenk autonomous okrugs, Khatangsky
# district of Taymyr Autonomous Okrug.  As a result Evenk Autonomous
# Okrug and Khatangsky district of Taymyr Autonomous Okrug would end
# up on Moscow+4, Tyumen Oblast on Moscow+2 and the rest on Moscow
# time.
#
# http://astrozet.net/files/Zones/DOC/RU/1980-925.txt
# attributes the 1982 changes to the Act of the Council of Ministers
# of the USSR No. 126 from 18.02.1982.  1980-925.txt also adds
# Udmurtia to the list of affected territories and lists Khatangsky
# district separately from Taymyr Autonomous Okrug.  Probably erroneously.
#
# The affected territories are currently listed under Europe/Moscow,
# Asia/Yekaterinburg and Asia/Krasnoyarsk.
#
# 12. Udmurtia
# The fact that Udmurtia is depicted as a violator in the Nauka i
# Zhizn article hints at Izhevsk being on different time from
# Kuybyshev before 1981-10-01. Udmurtia is not mentioned in the 1989 act.
# http://astrozet.net/files/Zones/DOC/RU/1980-925.txt
# implies Udmurtia was on Moscow time after 1982-04-01.
# Wikipedia implies Udmurtia being on Moscow+1 until 1991.
#
# ...
#
# All Russian zones are supposed to have by default a -1 change at
# 1991-03-31 2:00 (cancellation of the decree time in the USSR) and a +1
# change at 1992-01-19 2:00 (restoration of the decree time in Russia).
#
# There were some exceptions, though.
# Wikipedia says newspapers listed Astrakhan, Saratov, Kirov, Volgograd,
# Izhevsk, Grozny, Kazan and Samara as such exceptions for the 1992
# change. (Different newspapers providing different lists. And some
# lists found in the internet are quite wild.)
#
# And apparently some exceptions were reverted in the last moment.
# http://www.kaliningradka.ru/site_pc/cherez/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=40091
# says that Kaliningrad decided not to be an exception 2 days before the
# 1991-03-31 switch and one person at
# https://izhevsk.ru/forum_light_message/50/682597-m8369040.html
# says he remembers that Samara opted out of the 1992-01-19 exception
# 2 days before the switch.
#
# From Alois Treindl (2022-02-15):
# the Russian wikipedia page
# https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Московское_время#Перемещение_границы_применения_московского_времени_на_восток
# contains the sentence (in Google translation) "In the autumn of
# 1981, Arkhangelsk, Vologda, Yaroslavl, Ivanovo, Vladimir, Ryazan,
# Lipetsk, Voronezh, Rostov-on-Don, Krasnodar and regions to the east
# of those named (about 30 in total) parted ways with Moscow time.
# However, the convenience of common time with Moscow turned out to be
# decisive - in 1982, these regions again switched to Moscow time."

# Russian book Zaitsev A., Kutalev D. A new astrologer's reference
# book. Coordinates of cities and time corrections, - The World of
# Urania, 2012 (Russian: Зайцев А., Куталёв Д., Новый справочник

# To me it seems that an extra zone is needed, which starts with LMT
# util 1919, later follows Moscow since 1930, but deviates from it
# between 1 October 1981 until 1 April 1982.
#
#
# From Paul Eggert (2022-02-15):
# Given the above, we appear to be missing some Zone entries for the
# chaotic early 1980s in Russia.  It's not clear what these entries
# should be.  For now, sweep this under the rug and just document the
# time in Moscow.

# From Vladimir Karpinsky (2014-07-08):
# LMT in Moscow (before Jul 3, 1916) is 2:30:17, that was defined by Moscow
# Observatory (coordinates: 55° 45' 29.70", 37° 34' 05.30")....
# LMT in Moscow since Jul 3, 1916 is 2:31:01 as a result of new standard.
# (The info is from the book by Byalokoz ... p. 18.)
# The time in St. Petersburg as capital of Russia was defined by
# Pulkov observatory, near St. Petersburg.  In 1916 LMT Moscow
# was synchronized with LMT St. Petersburg (+30 minutes), (Pulkov observatory
# coordinates: 59° 46' 18.70", 30° 19' 40.70") so 30° 19' 40.70" >
# 2h01m18.7s = 2:01:19.  LMT Moscow = LMT St.Petersburg + 30m 2:01:19 + 0:30 =
# 2:31:19 ...
#

# 1994-09-25 03:00, but that can't be right.  For now, guess it

# Srednekolymsk and Zyryanka are the most populous places amongst these

# From Paul Eggert (2016-12-14):

# Anuario del Observatorio Astronómico de Madrid (2013, in Spanish).
# http://astronomia.ign.es/rknowsys-theme/images/webAstro/paginas/documentos/Anuario/lahoraoficialenespana.pdf
# As this source says that historical time in the Canaries is obscure,
# and it does not discuss Ceuta, stick with Shanks for now for that data.
#
# In the 1918 and 1919 fallback transitions in Spain, the clock for
# the hour-longer day officially kept going after midnight, so that
# the repeated instances of that day's 00:00 hour were 24 hours apart,
# with a fallback transition from the second occurrence of 00:59... to
# the next day's 00:00.  Our data format cannot represent this
# directly, and instead repeats the first hour of the next day, with a
# fallback transition from the next day's 00:59... to 00:00.

# From Alois Treindl (2008-12-17):
# I have researched the DST usage in Switzerland during the 1940ies.
#
# As I wrote in an earlier message, I suspected the current tzdata values
# to be wrong. This is now verified.
#
# I have found copies of the original ruling by the Swiss Federal
# government, in 'Eidgenössische Gesetzessammlung 1941 and 1942' (Swiss
# federal law collection)...
#
# DST began on Monday 5 May 1941, 1:00 am by shifting the clocks to 2:00 am
# DST ended on Monday 6 Oct 1941, 2:00 am by shifting the clocks to 1:00 am.
#
# DST began on Monday, 4 May 1942 at 01:00 am
# DST ended on Monday, 5 Oct 1942 at 02:00 am
#
# There was no DST in 1940, I have checked the law collection carefully.
# It is also indicated by the fact that the 1942 entry in the law
# collection points back to 1941 as a reference, but no reference to any
# other years are made.
#
# Newspaper articles I have read in the archives on 6 May 1941 reported
# about the introduction of DST (Sommerzeit in German) during the previous
# night as an absolute novelty, because this was the first time that such
# a thing had happened in Switzerland.
#
# I have also checked 1916, because one book source (Gabriel, Traité de
# l'heure dans le monde) claims that Switzerland had DST in 1916. This is
# false, no official document could be found. Probably Gabriel got misled
# by references to Germany, which introduced DST in 1916 for the first time.
#
# The tzdata rules for Switzerland must be changed to:
# Rule  Swiss   1941    1942    -       May     Mon>=1  1:00    1:00    S
# Rule  Swiss   1941    1942    -       Oct     Mon>=1  2:00    0       -
#
# The 1940 rules must be deleted.
#
# One further detail for Switzerland, which is probably out of scope for
# most users of tzdata: The [Europe/Zurich zone] ...
# describes all of Switzerland correctly, with the exception of
# the Canton de Genève (Geneva, Genf). Between 1848 and 1894 Geneva did not
# follow Bern Mean Time but kept its own local mean time.
# To represent this, an extra zone would be needed.
#
# From Alois Treindl (2013-09-11):
# The Federal regulations say
# https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20071096/index.html
# ... the meridian for Bern mean time ... is 7° 26' 22.50".
# Expressed in time, it is 0h29m45.5s.

# From Pierre-Yves Berger (2013-09-11):
# the "Circulaire du conseil fédéral" (December 11 1893)
# http://www.amtsdruckschriften.bar.admin.ch/viewOrigDoc.do?id=10071353
# clearly states that the [1894-06-01] change should be done at midnight
# but if no one is present after 11 at night, could be postponed until one
# hour before the beginning of service.

# From Paul Eggert (2024-05-24):
# Express BMT as 0:29:45.500, approximately the same precision 7° 26' 22.50".
#
# We can find no reliable source for Shanks's assertion that all of Switzerland
# except Geneva switched to Bern Mean Time at 00:00 on 1848-09-12.  This book:
#
#	Jakob Messerli. Gleichmässig, pünktlich, schnell. Zeiteinteilung und
#	Zeitgebrauch in der Schweiz im 19. Jahrhundert. Chronos, Zurich 1995,
#	ISBN 3-905311-68-2, OCLC 717570797.
#
# suggests that the transition was more gradual, and that the Swiss did not
# agree about civil time during the transition.  The timekeeping it gives the
# most detail for is postal and telegraph time: here, federal legislation (the
# "Bundesgesetz über die Erstellung von elektrischen Telegraphen") passed on
# 1851-11-23, and an official implementation notice was published 1853-07-16
# (Bundesblatt 1853, Bd. II, S. 859).  On p 72 Messerli writes that in
# practice since July 1853 Bernese time was used in "all postal and telegraph
# offices in Switzerland from Geneva to St. Gallen and Basel to Chiasso"
# (Google translation).  For now, model this transition as occurring on
# 1853-07-16, though it probably occurred at some other date in Zurich, and
# legal civil time probably changed at still some other transition date.

# From Tobias Conradi (2011-09-12):
# Büsingen <http://www.buesingen.de>, surrounded by the Swiss canton
# Schaffhausen, did not start observing DST in 1980 as the rest of DE
# (West Germany at that time) and DD (East Germany at that time) did.
# DD merged into DE, the area is currently covered by code DE in ISO 3166-1,
# which in turn is covered by the zone Europe/Berlin.

# Ukraine

# From Alois Treindl (2014-03-01):
# REGULATION A N O V A on March 20, 1992 N 139 ...  means that from
# 1992 on, Ukraine had DST with begin time at 02:00 am, on last Sunday
# in March, and end time 03:00 am, last Sunday in September....
# CABINET OF MINISTERS OF UKRAINE RESOLUTION on May 13, 1996 N 509
# "On the order of computation time on the territory of Ukraine" ....
# As this cabinet decision is from May 1996, it seems likely that the
# transition in March 1996, which predates it, was still at 2:00 am

# First in Ukraine they changed Time zone from UTC+3 to UTC+2 with DST:
#       03 25 1990 02:00 -03.00 1       Time Zone 3 with DST

#
# ...the European time rules are...standardized since 1981, when
# most European countries started DST.  Before that year, only
# a few countries (UK, France, Italy) had DST, each according
# to own national rules.  In 1981, however, DST started on
# 'Apr firstSun', and not on 'Mar lastSun' as in the following
# years...
# But also since 1981 there are some more national exceptions
# than listed in 'europe': Switzerland, for example, joined DST
# one year later, Denmark ended DST on 'Oct 1' instead of 'Sep
# lastSun' in 1981 - I don't know how they handle now.
#
# Finally, DST ist always from 'Apr 1' to 'Oct 1' in the
# Soviet Union (as far as I know).

#
# The information from Tom Hofmann is (as far as I know) not entirely correct.
# After a request from chongo at amdahl I tried to retrieve all information
# about DST in Europe.  I was able to find all from about 1969.
#
# ...standardization on DST in Europe started in about 1977 with switches on
# first Sunday in April and last Sunday in September...
# In 1981 UK joined Europe insofar that
# the starting day for both shifted to last Sunday in March.  And from 1982
# the whole of Europe used DST, with switch dates April 1 and October 1 in
# the Sov[i]et Union.  In 1985 the SU reverted to standard Europe[a]n switch
# dates...
#
# It should also be remembered that time-zones are not constants; e.g.
# Portugal switched in 1976 from MET (or CET) to WET with DST...
# Note also that though there were rules for switch dates not
# all countries abided to these dates, and many individual deviations
# occurred, though not since 1982 I believe.  Another note: it is always
# assumed that DST is 1 hour ahead of normal time, this need not be the
# case; at least in the Netherlands there have been times when DST was 2 hours
# in advance of normal time.

###############################################################################

# United States

# From Paul Eggert (1999-03-31):
# Howse writes (pp 121-125) that time zones were invented by
# Professor Charles Ferdinand Dowd (1825-1904),
# Principal of Temple Grove Ladies' Seminary (Saratoga Springs, NY).
# His pamphlet "A System of National Time for Railroads" (1870)
# was the result of his proposals at the Convention of Railroad Trunk Lines
# in New York City (1869-10).  His 1870 proposal was based on Washington, DC,
# but in 1872-05 he moved the proposed origin to Greenwich.

# From Paul Eggert (2024-11-18):
# Dowd's proposal left many details unresolved, such as where to draw
# lines between time zones.  Sandford Fleming of the Canadian Pacific Railway
# argued for Dowd's proposal in 1876, and Cleveland Abbe of the American
# Meteorology Society published a report in 1879 recommending four US time
# zones based on GMT.  However, the key individual who made time zones
# work in the US was William Frederick Allen - railway engineer,
# managing editor of the Travelers' Guide, and secretary of the
# General Time Convention, a railway standardization group.  Allen
# spent months in dialogs with scientific and railway leaders,
# developed a workable plan to institute time zones, and presented it
# to the General Time Convention on 1883-04-11, saying that his plan
# meant "local time would be practically abolished" - a plus for
# railway scheduling.  By the next convention on 1883-10-11 nearly all
# railroads had agreed and it took effect on 1883-11-18.  That Sunday
# was called the "day of two noons", as some locations observed noon
# twice.  Allen witnessed the transition in New York City, writing:
#
#   I heard the bells of St. Paul's strike on the old time.  Four
#   minutes later, obedient to the electrical signal from the Naval
#   Observatory ... the time-ball made its rapid descent, the chimes
#   of old Trinity rang twelve measured strokes, and local time was
#   abandoned, probably forever.
#
# Most of the US soon followed suit.  See:
# Bartky IR. The adoption of standard time. Technol Cult 1989 Jan;30(1):25-56.
# https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3105430

# From Paul Eggert (2005-04-16):
# That 1883 transition occurred at 12:00 new time, not at 12:00 old time.
# See p 46 of David Prerau, Seize the daylight, Thunder's Mouth Press (2005).

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# A good source for time zone historical data in the US is
# Thomas G. Shanks, The American Atlas (5th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1991).
# Make sure you have the errata sheet; the book is somewhat useless without it.
# It is the source for most of the pre-1991 US entries below.

# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
# Daylight Saving Time was first suggested as a joke by Benjamin Franklin
# in his whimsical essay "An Economical Project for Diminishing the Cost
# of Light" published in the Journal de Paris (1784-04-26).
# Not everyone is happy with the results:
#
#	I don't really care how time is reckoned so long as there is some
#	agreement about it, but I object to being told that I am saving
#	daylight when my reason tells me that I am doing nothing of the kind.
#	I even object to the implication that I am wasting something
#	valuable if I stay in bed after the sun has risen.  As an admirer
#	of moonlight I resent the bossy insistence of those who want to
#	reduce my time for enjoying it.  At the back of the Daylight Saving
#	scheme I detect the bony, blue-fingered hand of Puritanism, eager
#	to push people into bed earlier, and get them up earlier, to make
#	them healthy, wealthy and wise in spite of themselves.

# Shanks says that DST was called "War Time" in the US in 1918 and 1919.
# However, DST was imposed by the Standard Time Act of 1918, which
# was the first nationwide legal time standard, and apparently
# time was just called "Standard Time" or "Daylight Saving Time".

# From Paul Eggert (2019-06-04):
# Here is the legal basis for the US federal rules.
# * Public Law 65-106 (1918-03-19) implemented standard and daylight saving
#   time for the first time across the US, springing forward on March's last
#   Sunday and falling back on October's last Sunday.

# * Public Law 66-40 (1919-08-20) repealed DST on October 1919's last Sunday.
#   https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/66th-congress/session-1/c66s1ch51.pdf
# * Public Law 77-403 (1942-01-20) started wartime DST on 1942-02-09.

# * Public Law 79-187 (1945-09-25) ended wartime DST on 1945-09-30.
#   https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/79th-congress/session-1/c79s1ch388.pdf
# * Public Law 89-387 (1966-04-13) reinstituted a national standard for DST,

#   https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-80/pdf/STATUTE-80-Pg107.pdf

# All transitions are at 02:00 local time.

# From Arthur David Olson:
# Before the Uniform Time Act of 1966 took effect in 1967, observance of
# Daylight Saving Time in the US was by local option, except during wartime.

# From Arthur David Olson (2000-09-25):
# Last night I heard part of a rebroadcast of a 1945 Arch Oboler radio drama.
# In the introduction, Oboler spoke of "Eastern Peace Time."
# An AltaVista search turned up:
# https://web.archive.org/web/20000926032210/http://rowayton.org/rhs/hstaug45.html
# "When the time is announced over the radio now, it is 'Eastern Peace
# Time' instead of the old familiar 'Eastern War Time.'  Peace is wonderful."
# (August 1945) by way of confirmation.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-09-23):
# This was the V-J Day issue of the Clamdigger, a Rowayton, CT newsletter.

# From Joseph Gallant citing
# George H. Douglas, _The Early Days of Radio Broadcasting_ (1987):
# At 7 P.M. (Eastern War Time) [on 1945-08-14], the networks were set
# to switch to London for Attlee's address, but the American people
# never got to hear his speech live. According to one press account,
# CBS' Bob Trout was first to announce the word of Japan's surrender,
# but a few seconds later, NBC, ABC and Mutual also flashed the word
# of surrender, all of whom interrupting the bells of Big Ben in
# London which were to precede Mr. Attlee's speech.

# From Paul Eggert (2003-02-09): It was Robert St John, not Bob Trout.  From
# Myrna Oliver's obituary of St John on page B16 of today's Los Angeles Times:
#
# ... a war-weary U.S. clung to radios, awaiting word of Japan's surrender.
# Any announcement from Asia would reach St. John's New York newsroom on a
# wire service teletype machine, which had prescribed signals for major news.
# Associated Press, for example, would ring five bells before spewing out
# typed copy of an important story, and 10 bells for news "of transcendental
# importance."
#
# On Aug. 14, stalling while talking steadily into the NBC networks' open
# microphone, St. John heard five bells and waited only to hear a sixth bell,
# before announcing confidently: "Ladies and gentlemen, World War II is over.
# The Japanese have agreed to our surrender terms."
#
# He had scored a 20-second scoop on other broadcasters.

# From Arthur David Olson (2005-08-22):
# Paul has been careful to use the "US" rules only in those locations
# that are part of the United States; this reflects the real scope of
# U.S. government action.  So even though the "US" rules have changed
# in the latest release, other countries won't be affected.

# Early this summer I had the occasion to visit the Mount Washington
# Observatory weather station atop (of course!) Mount Washington [, NH]....
# One of the staff members said that the station was on Eastern Standard Time
# and didn't change their clocks for Daylight Saving ... so that their
# reports will always have times which are 5 hours behind UTC.

# From Paul Eggert (2005-08-26):
# According to today's Huntsville Times
# http://www.al.com/news/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?/base/news/1125047783228320.xml&coll=1
# a few towns on Alabama's "eastern border with Georgia, such as Phenix City
# in Russell County, Lanett in Chambers County and some towns in Lee County,
# set their watches and clocks on Eastern time."  It quotes H.H. "Bubba"
# Roberts, city administrator in Phenix City. as saying "We are in the Central
# time zone, but we do go by the Eastern time zone because so many people work
# in Columbus."
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-02-22):
# Four cities are involved.  The two not mentioned above are Smiths Station
# and Valley.  Barbara Brooks, Valley's assistant treasurer, heard it started
# because West Point Pepperell textile mills were in Alabama while the
# corporate office was in Georgia, and residents voted to keep Eastern
# time even after the mills closed.  See: Kazek K. Did you know which
# Alabama towns are in a different time zone?  al.com 2017-02-06.

# From Paul Eggert (2018-01-07):
# In 1869 the Chicago Astronomical Society contracted with the city to keep
# time.  Though delayed by the Great Fire, by 1880 a wire ran from the
# Dearborn Observatory (on the University of Chicago campus) to City Hall,
# which then sent signals to police and fire stations.  However, railroads got
# their time signals from the Allegheny Observatory, the Madison Observatory,
# the Ann Arbor Observatory, etc., so their clocks did not agree with each
# other or with the city's official time.  The confusion took some years to
# clear up.  See:

# From an email administrator of the City of Fort Pierre, SD (2015-12-21):
# Fort Pierre is technically located in the Mountain time zone as is
# the rest of Stanley County.  Most of Stanley County and Fort Pierre

# Pierre so it simplifies schedules.  I have lived in Stanley County

#
# From Paul Eggert (2015-12-25):
# Assume this practice predates 1970, so Fort Pierre can use America/Chicago.

# From Paul Eggert (2015-04-06):
# In 1950s Nashville a public clock had dueling faces, one for conservatives
# and the other for liberals; the two sides didn't agree about the time of day.
# I haven't found a photo of this clock, nor have I tracked down the TIME
# magazine report cited below, but here's the story as told by the late
# American journalist John Seigenthaler, who was there:
#
# "The two [newspaper] owners held strongly contrasting political and
# ideological views.  Evans was a New South liberal, Stahlman an Old South
# conservative, and their two papers frequently clashed editorially, often on
# the same day....  In the 1950s as the state legislature was grappling with
# the question of whether to approve daylight saving time for the entire state,
# TIME magazine reported:
#
# "'The Nashville Banner and The Nashville Tennessean rarely agree on anything
# but the time of day - and last week they couldn't agree on that.'
#
# "It was all too true. The clock on the front of the building had two faces -
# The Tennessean side of the building facing west, the other, east.  When it
# was high noon Banner time, it was 11 a.m. Tennessean time."
#
# Seigenthaler J. For 100 years, Tennessean had it covered.

# From Paul Eggert (2018-10-25):
# On 1921-03-04 federal law placed all of Texas into the central time zone.
# However, El Paso ignored the law for decades and continued to observe

# and they weren't about to let the federal government tell them what to do.
# Eventually the federal government gave in and changed the law on
# 1970-04-10 to match what El Paso was actually doing.  Although

# From Paul Eggert (2016-08-20):
# In early February 1948, in response to California's electricity shortage,
# PG&E changed power frequency from 60 to 59.5 Hz during daylight hours,
# causing electric clocks to lose six minutes per day.  (This did not change
# legal time, and is not part of the data here.)  See:
# Ross SA. An energy crisis from the past: Northern California in 1948.
# Working Paper No. 8, Institute of Governmental Studies, UC Berkeley,
# 1973-11.  https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8x22k30c
#
# In another measure to save electricity, DST was instituted from 1948-03-14
# at 02:01 to 1949-01-16 at 02:00, with the governor having the option to move
# the fallback transition earlier.  See pages 3-4 of:
# http://clerk.assembly.ca.gov/sites/clerk.assembly.ca.gov/files/archive/Statutes/1948/48Vol1_Chapters.pdf
#
# In response:
#
#   Governor Warren received a torrent of objecting mail, and it is not too much
#   to speculate that the objections to Daylight Saving Time were one important
#   factor in the defeat of the Dewey-Warren Presidential ticket in California.
#     -- Ross, p 25
#
# On December 8 the governor exercised the option, setting the date to January 1
# (LA Times 1948-12-09).  The transition time was 02:00 (LA Times 1949-01-01).
#
# Despite the controversy, in 1949 California voters approved Proposition 12,
# which established DST from April's last Sunday at 01:00 until September's
# last Sunday at 02:00. This was amended by 1962's Proposition 6, which changed
# the fall-back date to October's last Sunday. See:

# Alaska
# AK%sT is the modern abbreviation for -09 per USNO.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-06-15):
# Howse writes that Alaska switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar,
# and from east-of-GMT to west-of-GMT days, when the US bought it from Russia.
# On Friday, 1867-10-18 (Gregorian), at precisely 15:30 local time, the
# Russian forts and fleet at Sitka fired salutes to mark the ceremony of
# formal transfer.  See the Sacramento Daily Union (1867-11-14), p 3, col 2.
# https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SDU18671114.2.12.1
# Sitka workers did not change their calendars until Sunday, 1867-10-20,
# and so celebrated two Sundays that week.  See: Ahllund T (tr Hallamaa P).
# From the memoirs of a Finnish workman. Alaska History. 2006 Fall;21(2):1-25.
# http://alaskahistoricalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ahllund-2006-Memoirs-of-a-Finnish-Workman.pdf
# Include only the time zone part of this transition, ignoring the switch
# from Julian to Gregorian, since we can't represent the Julian calendar.
#
# As far as we know, of the locations mentioned below only Sitka was
# permanently inhabited in 1867 by anyone using either calendar.
# (Yakutat was colonized by the Russians in 1799, but the settlement was
# destroyed in 1805 by a Yakutat-kon war party.)  Many of Alaska's inhabitants
# were unaware of the US acquisition of Alaska, much less of any calendar or
# time change.  However, the Russian-influenced part of Alaska did observe
# Russian time, and it is more accurate to model this than to ignore it.
# The database format requires an exact transition time; use the Russian
# salute as a somewhat-arbitrary time for the formal transfer of control for
# all of Alaska.  Sitka's UTC offset is -9:01:13; adjust its 15:30 to the
# local times of other Alaskan locations so that they change simultaneously.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-18):
# One opinion of the early 1980s turmoil in Alaska over time zones and
# daylight saving time appeared as graffiti on a Juneau airport wall:
# "Welcome to Juneau.  Please turn your watch back to the 19th century."
# See: Turner W. Alaska's four time zones now two. NY Times 1983-11-01.

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-02-01):
# Here's database-relevant material from the 2001 "Alaska History" article:
#
# On September 20 [1979]...DOT...officials decreed that on April 27,
# 1980, Juneau and other nearby communities would move to Yukon Time.
# Sitka, Petersburg, Wrangell, and Ketchikan, however, would remain on
# Pacific Time.
#
# ...on September 22, 1980, DOT Secretary Neil E. Goldschmidt rescinded the
# Department's September 1979 decision. Juneau and other communities in
# northern Southeast reverted to Pacific Time on October 26.
#
# On October 28 [1983]...the Metlakatla Indian Community Council voted
# unanimously to keep the reservation on Pacific Time.
#
# According to DOT official Joanne Petrie, Indian reservations are not
# bound to follow time zones imposed by neighboring jurisdictions.
#
# (The last is consistent with how the database now handles the Navajo
# Nation.)

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-02-09):
# I just spoke by phone with a staff member at the Metlakatla Indian
# Community office (using contact information available at
# http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/commdb/CIS.cfm?Comm_Boro_name=Metlakatla
# It's shortly after 1:00 here on the east coast of the United States;
# the staffer said it was shortly after 10:00 there. When I asked whether
# that meant they were on Pacific time, they said no - they were on their
# own time. I asked about daylight saving; they said it wasn't used. I
# did not inquire about practices in the past.

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-08-17):
# For lack of better information, assume that Metlakatla's
# abandonment of use of daylight saving resulted from the 1983 vote.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2015-11-09):
# It seems Metlakatla did go off PST on Sunday, November 1, changing
# their time to AKST and are going to follow Alaska's DST, switching
# between AKST and AKDT from now on....

# From Ryan Stanley (2018-11-06):

# The following switches don't make our 1970 cutoff.
#
# Kiska observed Tokyo date and time during Japanese occupation from
# 1942-06-06 to 1943-07-29, and similarly for Attu from 1942-06-07 to
# 1943-05-29 (all dates American).  Both islands are now uninhabited.
#
# Shanks writes that part of southwest Alaska (e.g. Aniak)
# switched from -11:00 to -10:00 on 1968-09-22 at 02:00,
# and another part (e.g. Akiak) made the same switch five weeks later.
#
# From David Flater (2004-11-09):
# In e-mail, 2004-11-02, Ray Hudson, historian/liaison to the Unalaska
# Historic Preservation Commission, provided this information, which
# suggests that Unalaska deviated from statutory time from early 1967
# possibly until 1983:
#
#  Minutes of the Unalaska City Council Meeting, January 10, 1967:
#  "Except for St. Paul and Akutan, Unalaska is the only important
#  location not on Alaska Standard Time.  The following resolution was
#  made by William Robinson and seconded by Henry Swanson: Be it
#  resolved that the City of Unalaska hereby goes to Alaska Standard
#  Time as of midnight Friday, January 13, 1967 (1 A.M. Saturday,
#  January 14, Alaska Standard Time.)  This resolution was passed with
#  three votes for and one against."

# Hawaii

# From Arthur David Olson (2010-12-09):
# "Hawaiian Time" by Robert C. Schmitt and Doak C. Cox appears on pages 207-225
# of volume 26 of The Hawaiian Journal of History (1992). As of 2010-12-09,
# the article is available at
# https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10524/239/2/JL26215.pdf
# and indicates that standard time was adopted effective noon, January
# 13, 1896 (page 218), that in "1933, the Legislature decreed daylight
# saving for the period between the last Sunday of each April and the
# last Sunday of each September, but less than a month later repealed the
# act," (page 220), that year-round daylight saving time was in effect
# from 1942-02-09 to 1945-09-30 (page 221, with no time of day given for
# when clocks changed) and that clocks were changed by 30 minutes
# effective the second Sunday of June, 1947 (page 219, with no time of
# day given for when clocks changed). A footnote for the 1933 changes
# cites Session Laws of Hawaii 1933, "Act. 90 (approved 26 Apr. 1933)
# and Act 163 (approved 21 May 1933)."

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-01-19):
# The following is from "Laws of the Territory of Hawaii Passed by the
# Seventeenth Legislature: Regular Session 1933," available (as of
# 2011-01-19) at American University's Pence Law Library. Page 85: "Act
# 90...At 2 o'clock ante meridian of the last Sunday in April of each
# year, the standard time of this Territory shall be advanced one
# hour...This Act shall take effect upon its approval. Approved this 26th
# day of April, A. D. 1933. LAWRENCE M JUDD, Governor of the Territory of
# Hawaii." Page 172: "Act 163...Act 90 of the Session Laws of 1933 is
# hereby repealed...This Act shall take effect upon its approval, upon
# which date the standard time of this Territory shall be restored to
# that existing immediately prior to the taking effect of said Act 90.
# Approved this 21st day of May, A. D. 1933. LAWRENCE M. JUDD, Governor
# of the Territory of Hawaii."
#
# Note that 1933-05-21 was a Sunday.
# We're left to guess the time of day when Act 163 was approved; guess noon.

# Now we turn to US areas that have diverged from the consensus since 1970.

# Arizona mostly uses MST.

# From Paul Eggert (2002-10-20):

# The information in the rest of this paragraph is derived from the
# Daylight Saving Time web page
# <http://www.dlapr.lib.az.us/links/daylight.htm> (2002-01-23)
# maintained by the Arizona State Library, Archives and Public Records.
# Between 1944-01-01 and 1944-04-01 the State of Arizona used standard
# time, but by federal law railroads, airlines, bus lines, military
# personnel, and some engaged in interstate commerce continued to
# observe war (i.e., daylight saving) time.  The 1944-03-17 Phoenix
# Gazette says that was the date the law changed, and that 04-01 was
# the date the state's clocks would change.  In 1945 the State of
# Arizona used standard time all year, again with exceptions only as
# mandated by federal law.  Arizona observed DST in 1967, but Arizona
# Laws 1968, ch. 183 (effective 1968-03-21) repealed DST.
#
# Shanks says the 1944 experiment came to an end on 1944-03-17.
# Go with the Arizona State Library instead.

# Indiana
#
# For a map of Indiana's time zone regions, see:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Indiana
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-11-30):
# A brief but entertaining history of time in Indiana describes a 1949 debate
# in the Indiana House where city legislators (who favored "fast time")
# tussled with farm legislators (who didn't) over a bill to outlaw DST:
#  "Lacking enough votes, the city faction tries to filibuster until time runs
#   out on the session at midnight, but rural champion Rep. Herbert Copeland,
#   R-Madison, leans over the gallery railing and forces the official clock
#   back to 9 p.m., breaking it in the process.  The clock sticks on 9 as the
#   debate rages on into the night.  The filibuster finally dies out and the
#   bill passes, while outside the chamber, clocks read 3:30 a.m.  In the end,
#   it doesn't matter which side won.  The law has no enforcement powers and
#   is simply ignored by fast-time communities."
# How Indiana went from 'God's time' to split zones and daylight-saving.

#
# From Paul Eggert (2007-08-17):
# Since 1970, most of Indiana has been like America/Indiana/Indianapolis,
# with the following exceptions:
#
# - Gibson, Jasper, Lake, LaPorte, Newton, Porter, Posey, Spencer,
#   Vanderburgh, and Warrick counties have been like America/Chicago.
#
# - Dearborn and Ohio counties have been like America/New_York.
#
# - Clark, Floyd, and Harrison counties have been like
#   America/Kentucky/Louisville.
#
# - Crawford, Daviess, Dubois, Knox, Martin, Perry, Pike, Pulaski, Starke,
#   and Switzerland counties have their own time zone histories as noted below.
#
# Shanks partitioned Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
# and wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."
# Those Hoosiers!  Such a flighty and changeable people!
# Fortunately, most of the complexity occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.
#
# Other than Indianapolis, the Indiana place names are so nondescript
# that they would be ambiguous if we left them at the 'America' level.
# So we reluctantly put them all in a subdirectory 'America/Indiana'.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-26):
# https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2006/01/20/06-563/standard-time-zone-boundary-in-the-state-of-indiana
# says "DOT is relocating the time zone boundary in Indiana to move Starke,
# Pulaski, Knox, Daviess, Martin, Pike, Dubois, and Perry Counties from the
# Eastern Time Zone to the Central Time Zone.... The effective date of
# this rule is 2 a.m. EST Sunday, April 2, 2006, which is the
# changeover date from standard time to Daylight Saving Time."
# Strictly speaking, this meant the affected counties changed their
# clocks twice that night, but this obviously was in error.  The intent
# was that 01:59:59 EST be followed by 02:00:00 CDT.

# From Gwillim Law (2007-02-10):
# The Associated Press has been reporting that Pulaski County, Indiana is
# going to switch from Central to Eastern Time on March 11, 2007....

# Wayne County, Kentucky
#
# From Lake Cumberland LIFE
# http://www.lake-cumberland.com/life/archive/news990129time.shtml
# (1999-01-29) via WKYM-101.7:
# Clinton County has joined Wayne County in asking the DoT to change from
# the Central to the Eastern time zone....  The Wayne County government made
# the same request in December.  And while Russell County officials have not
# taken action, the majority of respondents to a poll conducted there in
# August indicated they would like to change to "fast time" also.
# The three Lake Cumberland counties are the farthest east of any U.S.
# location in the Central time zone.
#
# From Rich Wales (2000-08-29):

# From Rives McDow (2000-08-30):
# Here ... are all the changes in the US since 1985.
# Kearny County, KS (put all of county on central;
#	previously split between MST and CST) ... 1990-10
# Starke County, IN (from CST to EST) ... 1991-10
# Oliver County, ND (from MST to CST) ... 1992-10
# West Wendover, NV (from PST TO MST) ... 1999-10
# Wayne County, KY (from CST to EST) ... 2000-10
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-07-17):
# We don't know where the line used to be within Kearny County, KS,
# so omit that change for now.
# See America/Indiana/Knox for the Starke County, IN change.
# See America/North_Dakota/Center for the Oliver County, ND change.
# West Wendover, NV officially switched from Pacific to mountain time on
# 1999-10-31.  See the
# Federal Register 64, 203 (1999-10-21), pp 56705-56707.
# https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1999-10-21/html/99-27240.htm
# However, the Federal Register says that West Wendover already operated
# on mountain time, and the rule merely made this official;
# hence a separate tz entry is not needed.

# Michigan
#
# From Bob Devine (1988-01-28):
# Michigan didn't observe DST from 1968 to 1973.
#
# From Paul Eggert (1999-03-31):
# Shanks writes that Michigan started using standard time on 1885-09-18,
# but Howse writes (pp 124-125, referring to Popular Astronomy, 1901-01)
# that Detroit kept
#
#	local time until 1900 when the City Council decreed that clocks should
#	be put back twenty-eight minutes to Central Standard Time.  Half the
#	city obeyed, half refused.  After considerable debate, the decision
#	was rescinded and the city reverted to Sun time.  A derisive offer to
#	erect a sundial in front of the city hall was referred to the
#	Committee on Sewers.  Then, in 1905, Central time was adopted
#	by city vote.
#
# This story is too entertaining to be false, so go with Howse over Shanks.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
# Garland (1927) writes "Cleveland and Detroit advanced their clocks
# one hour in 1914."  This change is not in Shanks.  We have no more
# info, so omit this for now.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2019-07-06):
# Due to a complicated set of legal maneuvers, in 1967 Michigan did
# not start daylight saving time when the rest of the US did.
# Instead, it began DST on Jun 14 at 00:01.  This was big news:
# the Detroit Free Press reported it at the top of Page 1 on
# 1967-06-14, in an article "State Adjusting to Switch to Fast Time"
# by Gary Blonston, above an article about Thurgood Marshall's
# confirmation to the US Supreme Court.  Although Shanks says Detroit
# observed DST until 1967-10-29 00:01, that time of day seems to be
# incorrect, as the Free Press later said DST ended in Michigan at the
# same time as the rest of the US.  Also, although Shanks reports no DST in
# Detroit in 1968, it did observe DST that year; in the November 1968
# election Michigan voters narrowly repealed DST, effective 1969.
#
# Most of Michigan observed DST from 1973 on, but was a bit late in 1975.

# From Chris Walton (2011-12-01)
# In the first of Tammy Hardwick's articles
# http://www.ilovecreston.com/?p=articles&t=spec&ar=260
# she quotes the Friday November 1/1918 edition of the Creston Review.
# The quote includes these two statements:
# 'Sunday the CPR went back to the old system of time...'
# '... The daylight saving scheme was dropped all over Canada at the same time,'
# These statements refer to a transition from daylight time to standard time
# that occurred nationally on Sunday October 27/1918.  This transition was
# also documented in the Saturday October 26/1918 edition of the Toronto Star.

# In light of that evidence, we alter the date from the earlier believed
# Oct 31, to Oct 27, 1918 (and Sunday is a more likely transition day
# than Thursday) in all Canadian rulesets.

# west Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward I,
# Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Listuguj reserve

# From Brian Inglis (2015-07-20):
# From the historical weather station records available at:
# https://weatherspark.com/history/28351/1971/Sydney-Nova-Scotia-Canada
# Sydney shares the same time history as Glace Bay, so was
# likely to be the same across the island....
# Sydney, as the capital and most populous location, or Cape Breton, would
# have been better names for the zone had we known this in 1996.

# From Paul Eggert (2015-07-20):
# Shanks & Pottenger write that since 1970 most of this region has been like
# Halifax.  Many locales did not observe peacetime DST until 1972;
# the Cape Breton area, represented by Glace Bay, is the largest we know of
# (Glace Bay was perhaps not the best name choice but no point changing now).
# Shanks & Pottenger also write that Liverpool, NS was the only town
# in Canada to observe DST in 1971 but not 1970; for now we'll assume
# this is a typo.

# From Jeffery Nichols (2020-01-09):
# America/Halifax ... also applies to Îles-de-la-Madeleine and the Listuguj
# reserve in Quebec. Officially, this came into effect on January 1, 2007
# (Legal Time Act, CQLR c T-5.1), but the legislative debates surrounding that
# bill say that it is "accommodating the customs and practices" of those
# regions, which suggests that they have always been in-line with Halifax.

# Ontario

# From Mark Brader (2003-07-26):
# [According to the Toronto Star] Orillia, Ontario, adopted DST
# effective Saturday, 1912-06-22, 22:00; the article mentions that
# Port Arthur (now part of Thunder Bay, Ontario) as well as Moose Jaw
# have already done so.  In Orillia DST was to run until Saturday,
# 1912-08-31 (no time mentioned), but it was met with considerable
# hostility from certain segments of the public, and was revoked after
# only two weeks - I copied it as Saturday, 1912-07-07, 22:00, but
# presumably that should be -07-06.  (1912-06-19, -07-12; also letters
# earlier in June).
#
# Kenora, Ontario, was to abandon DST on 1914-06-01 (-05-21).
#

# reproduced in: Richardson M. "Daylight saving was a confusing
# time in Orillia" in the 2025-03-15 Orillia Matters. Richardson writes,
# "The first Sunday after the switch was made, [DST proponent and
# Orillia mayor William Sword] Frost walked into church an hour late.
# This became a symbol of the downfall of daylight saving in Orillia."
# The mayor became known as "Daylight Bill".

# From Mark Brader (2010-03-06):
#
# In the (Toronto) Globe and Mail for Saturday, 1955-09-24, in the bottom
# right corner of page 1, it says that Toronto will return to standard
# time at 2 am Sunday morning (which agrees with the database), and that:
#
#     The one-hour setback will go into effect throughout most of Ontario,
#     except in areas like Windsor which remains on standard time all year.
#
# ... I don't know if Windsor began observing DST when Detroit did,
# or in 1974, or on some other date.
#
# By the way, the article continues by noting that:
#
#     Some cities in the United States have pushed the deadline back
#     three weeks and will change over from daylight saving in October.

# From Chris Walton (2024-01-09):
# The [Toronto] changes in 1947, 1948, and 1949 took place at 2:00 a.m. local

#
#   A list of the places in Canada using daylight saving time would
# require yearly revision. From information kindly furnished by
# the provincial governments and by the postmasters in many cities
# and towns, it is found that the following places used daylight sav-
# ing in 1930. The information for the province of Quebec is definite,
# for the other provinces only approximate:
#
#	Province	Daylight saving time used
# Prince Edward Island	Not used.
# Nova Scotia		In Halifax only.
# New Brunswick		In St. John only.
# Quebec		In the following places:
#			Montreal	Lachine
#			Quebec		Mont-Royal
#			Lévis		Iberville
#			St. Lambert	Cap de la Madelèine
#			Verdun		Loretteville
#			Westmount	Richmond
#			Outremont	St. Jérôme
#			Longueuil	Greenfield Park
#			Arvida		Waterloo
#			Chambly-Canton	Beaulieu
#			Melbourne	La Tuque
#			St. Théophile	Buckingham
# Ontario		Used generally in the cities and towns along
#			the southerly part of the province. Not
#			used in the northwesterly part.
# Manitoba		Not used.
# Saskatchewan		In Regina only.
# Alberta		Not used.
# British Columbia	Not used.
#
#   With some exceptions, the use of daylight saving may be said to be limited
# to those cities and towns lying between Quebec city and Windsor, Ont.

# Manitoba

# From Rob Douglas (2006-04-06):
# the old Manitoba Time Act - as amended by Bill 2, assented to
# March 27, 1987 ... said ...
# "between two o'clock Central Standard Time in the morning of
# the first Sunday of April of each year and two o'clock Central
# Standard Time in the morning of the last Sunday of October next
# following, one hour in advance of Central Standard Time."...
# I believe that the English legislation [of the old time act] had
# been assented to (March 22, 1967)....
# Also, as far as I can tell, there was no order-in-council varying
# the time of Daylight Saving Time for 2005 and so the provisions of
# the 1987 version would apply - the changeover was at 2:00 Central
# Standard Time (i.e. not until 3:00 Central Daylight Time).

# From Paul Eggert (2006-04-10):
# Shanks & Pottenger say Manitoba switched at 02:00 (not 02:00s)
# starting 1966.  Since 02:00s is clearly correct for 1967 on, assume
# it was also 02:00s in 1966.

# Saskatchewan

# From Mark Brader (2003-07-26):
# The first actual adoption of DST in Canada was at the municipal
# level.  As the [Toronto] Star put it (1912-06-07), "While people
# elsewhere have long been talking of legislation to save daylight,
# the city of Moose Jaw [Saskatchewan] has acted on its own hook."
# DST in Moose Jaw began on Saturday, 1912-06-01 (no time mentioned:
# presumably late evening, as below), and would run until "the end of
# the summer".  The discrepancy between municipal time and railroad
# time was noted.

# From Paul Eggert (2003-07-27):
# Willett (1914-03) notes that DST "has been in operation ... in the
# City of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, for one year."

# From Paul Eggert (2019-07-25):
# Pearce's book says Regina observed DST in 1914-1917.  No dates and times,
# unfortunately.  It also says that in 1914 Saskatoon observed DST
# from 1 June to 6 July, and that DST was also tried out in Davidson,
# Melfort, and Prince Albert.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Shanks & Pottenger say that since 1970 this region has mostly been as Regina.
# Some western towns (e.g. Swift Current) switched from MST/MDT to CST in 1972.
# Other western towns (e.g. Lloydminster) are like Edmonton.
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) write that Denare Beach and Creighton
# are like Winnipeg, in violation of Saskatchewan law.

# From W. Jones (1992-11-06):
# The. . .below is based on information I got from our law library, the
# provincial archives, and the provincial Community Services department.
# A precise history would require digging through newspaper archives, and
# since you didn't say what you wanted, I didn't bother.
#
# Saskatchewan is split by a time zone meridian (105W) and over the years
# the boundary became pretty ragged as communities near it reevaluated
# their affiliations in one direction or the other.  In 1965 a provincial
# referendum favoured legislating common time practices.
#
# On 15 April 1966 the Time Act (c. T-14, Revised Statutes of
# Saskatchewan 1978) was proclaimed, and established that the eastern
# part of Saskatchewan would use CST year round, that districts in
# northwest Saskatchewan would by default follow CST but could opt to
# follow Mountain Time rules (thus 1 hour difference in the winter and
# zero in the summer), and that districts in southwest Saskatchewan would
# by default follow MT but could opt to follow CST.
#
# It took a few years for the dust to settle (I know one story of a town
# on one time zone having its school in another, such that a mom had to
# serve her family lunch in two shifts), but presently it seems that only
# a few towns on the border with Alberta (e.g. Lloydminster) follow MT
# rules any more; all other districts appear to have used CST year round
# since sometime in the 1960s.

# From Chris Walton (2006-06-26):
# The Saskatchewan time act which was last updated in 1996 is about 30 pages
# long and rather painful to read.

# Alberta

# From Alois Treindl (2019-07-19):
# There was no DST in Alberta in 1967... Calgary Herald, 29 April 1967.
# 1969, no DST, from Edmonton Journal 18 April 1969
#
# From Paul Eggert (2019-07-25):
# Pearce's book says that Alberta's 1948 Daylight Saving Act required
# Mountain Standard Time without DST, and that "anyone who broke that law
# could be fined up to $25 and costs".  There seems to be no record of
# anybody paying the fine.  The law was not changed until an August 1971
# plebiscite reinstituted DST in 1972.  This story is also mentioned in:

# British Columbia

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Shanks & Pottenger write that since 1970 most of this region has

# Dawson Creek uses MST.  Much of east BC is like Edmonton.

# From Matt Johnson (2015-09-21):
# Fort Nelson, BC, Canada will cancel DST this year.  So while previously they
# were aligned with America/Vancouver, they're now aligned with
# America/Dawson_Creek.
# http://www.northernrockies.ca/EN/meta/news/archives/2015/northern-rockies-time-change.html
#
# From Tim Parenti (2015-09-23):
# This requires a new zone for the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality,
# America/Fort_Nelson.  The resolution of 2014-12-08 was reached following a
# 2014-11-15 poll with nearly 75% support.  Effectively, the municipality has
# been on MST (-0700) like Dawson Creek since it advanced its clocks on
# 2015-03-08.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2019-07-25):
# Shanks says Fort Nelson did not observe DST in 1946, unlike Vancouver.
# Alois Treindl confirmed this on 07-22, citing the 1946-04-27 Vancouver Daily

# From Chris Walton (2022-11-06):
# The 5th edition of the Atlas of Canada contains a time zone map that

# From Rives McDow (1999-09-04):
# Nunavut ... moved ... to incorporate the whole territory into one time zone.
# Nunavut moves to single time zone Oct. 31
# http://www.nunatsiaq.com/nunavut/nvt90903_13.html

# From Paul Eggert (1999-09-20):
# Basic Facts: The New Territory
# http://www.nunavut.com/basicfacts/english/basicfacts_1territory.html
# (1999) reports that ... Coral Harbour does not observe DST.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) say the following, but we lack histories
# for these potential new Zones.
#
# The Canadian Forces station at Alert uses Eastern Time while the
# handful of residents at the Eureka weather station [in the Central
# zone] skip daylight savings.  Baffin Island, which is crossed by the
# Central, Eastern and Atlantic Time zones only uses Eastern Time.
# Gjoa Haven, Taloyoak and Pelly Bay all use Mountain instead of
# Central Time and Southampton Island [in the Central zone] is not
# required to use daylight savings.

# From <http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/archives/nunavut001130/nvt21110_02.html>
# Nunavut now has two time zones (2000-11-10):
# The Nunavut government would allow its employees in Kugluktuk and
# Cambridge Bay to operate on central time year-round, putting them
# one hour behind the rest of Nunavut for six months during the winter.
# At the end of October the two communities had rebelled against
# Nunavut's unified time zone, refusing to shift to eastern time with
# the rest of the territory for the winter.  Cambridge Bay remained on
# central time, while Kugluktuk, even farther west, reverted to
# mountain time, which they had used before the advent of Nunavut's
# unified time zone in 1999.
#
# From Rives McDow (2001-01-20), quoting the Nunavut government:
# The preceding decision came into effect at midnight, Saturday Nov 4, 2000.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-12-04):
# Let's just keep track of the official times for now.

# From Rives McDow (2001-03-07):
# The premier of Nunavut has issued a ministerial statement advising
# that effective 2001-04-01, the territory of Nunavut will revert
# back to three time zones (mountain, central, and eastern).  Of the
# cities in Nunavut, Coral Harbor is the only one that I know of that
# has said it will not observe dst, staying on EST year round.  I'm
# checking for more info, and will get back to you if I come up with
# more.
# [Also see <http://www.nunatsiaq.com/nunavut/nvt10309_06.html> (2001-03-09).]

# From Gwillim Law (2005-05-21):
# According to ...
# http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/SO98/geomap.asp
# (from a 1998 Canadian Geographic article), the de facto and de jure time
# for Southampton Island (at the north end of Hudson Bay) is UTC-5 all year
# round.  Using Google, it's easy to find other websites that confirm this.
# I wasn't able to find how far back this time regimen goes, but since it
# predates the creation of Nunavut, it probably goes back many years....
# The Inuktitut name of Coral Harbour is Sallit, but it's rarely used.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2014-10-17):
# For lack of better information, assume that Southampton Island observed
# daylight saving only during wartime.  Gwillim Law's email also
# mentioned maps now maintained by National Research Council Canada;
# see above for an up-to-date link.

# From Chris Walton (2007-03-01):
# ... the community of Resolute (located on Cornwallis Island in
# Nunavut) moved from Central Time to Eastern Time last November.
# Basically the community did not change its clocks at the end of
# daylight saving....
# http://www.nnsl.com/frames/newspapers/2006-11/nov13_06none.html

# From Chris Walton (2011-03-21):
# Back in 2007 I initiated the creation of a new "zone file" for Resolute
# Bay. Resolute Bay is a small community located about 900km north of
# the Arctic Circle. The zone file was required because Resolute Bay had
# decided to use UTC-5 instead of UTC-6 for the winter of 2006-2007.
#
# According to new information which I received last week, Resolute Bay
# went back to using UTC-6 in the winter of 2007-2008...
#
# On March 11/2007 most of Canada went onto daylight saving. On March
# 14/2007 I phoned the Resolute Bay hamlet office to do a "time check." I
# talked to somebody that was both knowledgeable and helpful. I was able
# to confirm that Resolute Bay was still operating on UTC-5. It was
# explained to me that Resolute Bay had been on the Eastern Time zone
# (EST) in the winter, and was now back on the Central Time zone (CDT).
# i.e. the time zone had changed twice in the last year but the clocks
# had not moved. The residents had to know which time zone they were in
# so they could follow the correct TV schedule...
#
# On Nov 02/2008 most of Canada went onto standard time. On Nov 03/2008 I
# phoned the Resolute Bay hamlet office...[D]ue to the challenging nature
# of the phone call, I decided to seek out an alternate source of
# information. I found an e-mail address for somebody by the name of
# Stephanie Adams whose job was listed as "Inns North Support Officer for
# Arctic Co-operatives." I was under the impression that Stephanie lived
# and worked in Resolute Bay...
#
# On March 14/2011 I phoned the hamlet office again. I was told that
# Resolute Bay had been using Central Standard Time over the winter of
# 2010-2011 and that the clocks had therefore been moved one hour ahead
# on March 13/2011. The person I talked to was aware that Resolute Bay
# had previously experimented with Eastern Standard Time but he could not
# tell me when the practice had stopped.
#
# On March 17/2011 I searched the Web to find an e-mail address of
# somebody that might be able to tell me exactly when Resolute Bay went
# off Eastern Standard Time. I stumbled on the name "Aziz Kheraj." Aziz
# used to be the mayor of Resolute Bay and he apparently owns half the
# businesses including "South Camp Inn." This website has some info on
# Aziz:
# http://www.uphere.ca/node/493
#
# I sent Aziz an e-mail asking when Resolute Bay had stopped using
# Eastern Standard Time.
#
# Aziz responded quickly with this: "hi, The time was not changed for the
# 1 year only, the following year, the community went back to the old way
# of "spring ahead-fall behind" currently we are zulu plus 5 hrs and in
# the winter Zulu plus 6 hrs"
#
# This of course conflicted with everything I had ascertained in November 2008.
#
# I sent Aziz a copy of my 2008 e-mail exchange with Stephanie. Aziz
# responded with this: "Hi, Stephanie lives in Winnipeg. I live here, You
# may want to check with the weather office in Resolute Bay or do a
# search on the weather through Env. Canada. web site"
#
# If I had realized the Stephanie did not live in Resolute Bay I would
# never have contacted her.  I now believe that all the information I
# obtained in November 2008 should be ignored...
# I apologize for reporting incorrect information in 2008.

# From Tim Parenti (2020-03-05):
# The government of Yukon announced [yesterday] the cessation of seasonal time
# changes.  "After clocks are pushed ahead one hour on March 8, the territory
# will remain on [UTC-07].  ... [The government] found 93 per cent of
# respondents wanted to end seasonal time changes and, of that group, 70 per
# cent wanted 'permanent Pacific Daylight Saving Time.'"
# https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-end-daylight-saving-time-1.5486358
#
# Although the government press release prefers PDT, we prefer MST for
# consistency with nearby Dawson Creek, Creston, and Fort Nelson.
# https://yukon.ca/en/news/yukon-end-seasonal-time-change

# From Andrew G. Smith (2020-09-24):
# Yukon has completed its regulatory change to be on UTC -7 year-round....
# http://www.gov.yk.ca/legislation/regs/oic2020_125.pdf
# What we have done is re-defined Yukon Standard Time, as we are
# authorized to do under section 33 of our Interpretation Act:
# http://www.gov.yk.ca/legislation/acts/interpretation_c.pdf
#
# From Paul Eggert (2020-09-24):
# tzdb uses the obsolete YST abbreviation for standard time in Yukon through
# about 1970, and uses PST for standard time in Yukon since then.  Consistent
# with that, use MST for -07, the new standard time in Yukon effective Nov. 1.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-12-07):
# The Investigation and Analysis Service of the
# Mexican Library of Congress (MLoC) has published a
# history of Mexican local time (in Spanish)
# http://www.diputados.gob.mx/bibliot/publica/inveyana/polisoc/horver/index.htm
#
# Here are the discrepancies between Shanks & Pottenger (S&P) and the MLoC.
# (In all cases we go with the MLoC.)
# S&P report that Baja was at -8:00 in 1922/1923.
# S&P say the 1930 transition in Baja was 1930-11-16.
# S&P report no DST during summer 1931.
# S&P report a transition at 1932-03-30 23:00, not 1932-04-01.

# From Gwillim Law (2001-02-20):
# There are some other discrepancies between the Decrees page and the
# tz database.  I think they can best be explained by supposing that
# the researchers who prepared the Decrees page failed to find some of
# the relevant documents.

# A guy from our Mexico subsidiary finally found the Presidential Decree
# outlining the timezone changes in Mexico.
#
# ------------- Begin Forwarded Message -------------
#
# I finally got my hands on the Official Presidential Decree that sets up the
# rules for the DST changes. The rules are:
#
# 1. The country is divided in 3 timezones:
#    - Baja California Norte (the Mexico/BajaNorte TZ)
#    - Baja California Sur, Nayarit, Sinaloa and Sonora (the Mexico/BajaSur TZ)
#    - The rest of the country (the Mexico/General TZ)
#
# 2. From the first Sunday in April at 2:00 AM to the last Sunday in October
#    at 2:00 AM, the times in each zone are as follows:
#    BajaNorte: GMT+7
#    BajaSur:   GMT+6
#    General:   GMT+5
#
# 3. The rest of the year, the times are as follows:
#    BajaNorte: GMT+8
#    BajaSur:   GMT+7
#    General:   GMT+6
#
# The Decree was published in Mexico's Official Newspaper on January 4th.

# "Diario Oficial: Time Zone Changeover" (1996-01-04).
# http://mexico-travel.com/extra/timezone_eng.html

# From Rives McDow (1998-10-08):
# The State of Quintana Roo has reverted back to central STD and DST times
# (i.e. UTC -0600 and -0500 as of 1998-08-02).

# From Rives McDow (2000-01-10):
# Effective April 4, 1999 at 2:00 AM local time, Sonora changed to the time
# zone 5 hours from the International Date Line, and will not observe daylight
# savings time so as to stay on the same time zone as the southern part of
# Arizona year round.

# From Jesper Nørgaard, translating
# <http://www.reforma.com/nacional/articulo/064327/> (2001-01-17):
# In Oaxaca, the 55.000 teachers from the Section 22 of the National

# year, so that the more than 10,000 schools work at normal hour the
# whole year.

# ... Mexico City Mayor López Obrador "...is threatening to keep

# observation of Daylight Saving Time.

# Official statute published by the Energy Department
# http://www.conae.gob.mx/ahorro/decretohorver2001.html#decre
# (2001-02-01) shows Baja and Chihauhua as still using US DST rules,
# and Sonora with no DST.  This was reported by Jesper Nørgaard (2001-02-03).

# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-03):
#
# https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-mar-03-mn-32561-story.html
# James F. Smith writes in today's LA Times
# * Sonora will continue to observe standard time.
# * Last week Mexico City's mayor Andrés Manuel López Obrador decreed that
#   the Federal District will not adopt DST.
# * 4 of 16 district leaders announced they'll ignore the decree.
# * The decree does not affect federal-controlled facilities including
#   the airport, banks, hospitals, and schools.
#
# For now we'll assume that the Federal District will bow to federal rules.

# From Jesper Nørgaard (2001-04-01):
# I found some references to the Mexican application of daylight
# saving, which modifies what I had already sent you, stating earlier
# that a number of northern Mexican states would go on daylight
# saving. The modification reverts this to only cover Baja California
# (Norte), while all other states (except Sonora, who has no daylight
# saving all year) will follow the original decree of president
# Vicente Fox, starting daylight saving May 6, 2001 and ending
# September 30, 2001.

# From Reuters (2001-09-04):
# Mexico's Supreme Court on Tuesday declared that daylight savings was
# unconstitutional in Mexico City, creating the possibility the
# capital will be in a different time zone from the rest of the nation
# next year....  The Supreme Court's ruling takes effect at 2:00
# a.m. (0800 GMT) on Sept. 30, when Mexico is scheduled to revert to
# standard time. "This is so residents of the Federal District are not
# subject to unexpected time changes," a statement from the court said.

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2002-03-12):
# ... consulting my local grocery store(!) and my coworkers, they all insisted

# http://www.conae.gob.mx/ahorro/horaver2001_m1_2002.html (2002-02-20)

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Formerly there was an America/Ensenada zone, which differed from
# America/Tijuana only in that it did not observe DST from 1976
# through 1995.  This was as per Shanks (1999).  But Shanks & Pottenger say
# Ensenada did not observe DST from 1948 through 1975.  Guy Harris reports
# that the 1987 OAG says "Only Ensenada, Mexicali, San Felipe and
# Tijuana observe DST," which agrees with Shanks & Pottenger but implies that
# DST-observance was a town-by-town matter back then.  This concerns
# data after 1970 so most likely there should be at least one Zone
# other than America/Tijuana for Baja, but it's not clear yet what its
# name or contents should be.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2015-10-08):
# Formerly there was an America/Santa_Isabel zone, but this appears to
# have come from a misreading of
# http://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5127480&fecha=06/01/2010
# It has been moved to the 'backward' file.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2022-10-28):
# Today's new law states that the entire state of Baja California
# follows US DST rules, which agrees with simplifications noted above.

# From Paul Eggert (2013-02-21):
# Milne gives -5:28:50.45 for the observatory at Havana, -5:29:23.57
# for the port, and -5:30 for meteorological observations.
# For now, stick with Shanks & Pottenger.

# From Arthur David Olson (1999-03-29):
# The 1999-03-28 exhibition baseball game held in Havana, Cuba, between
# the Cuban National Team and the Baltimore Orioles was carried live on
# the Orioles Radio Network, including affiliate WTOP in Washington, DC.
# During the game, play-by-play announcer Jim Hunter noted that
# "We'll be losing two hours of sleep...Cuba switched to Daylight Saving
# Time today."  (The "two hour" remark referred to losing one hour of
# sleep on 1999-03-28 - when the announcers were in Cuba as it switched
# to DST - and one more hour on 1999-04-04 - when the announcers will have
# returned to Baltimore, which switches on that date.)

# From Steffen Thorsen (2013-11-11):
# DST start in Cuba in 2004 ... does not follow the same rules as the
# years before.  The correct date should be Sunday 2004-03-28 00:00 ...

# From Evert van der Veer via Steffen Thorsen (2004-10-28):
# Cuba is not going back to standard time this year.
# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2004/septiembre/juev30/41medid-i.html
# says that it's due to a problem at the Antonio Guiteras
# thermoelectric plant, and says "This October there will be no return
# to normal hours (after daylight saving time)".
# For now, let's assume that it's a temporary measure.

# From Carlos A. Carnero Delgado (2005-11-12):
# This year (just like in 2004-2005) there's no change in time zone
# adjustment in Cuba.  We will stay in daylight saving time:
# http://www.granma.cu/espanol/2005/noviembre/mier9/horario.html

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2006-10-21):
# An article in GRANMA INTERNACIONAL claims that Cuba will end
# the 3 years of permanent DST next weekend, see
# http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2006/octubre/lun16/43horario.html
# "On Saturday night, October 28 going into Sunday, October 29, at 01:00,
# watches should be set back one hour - going back to 00:00 hours - returning
# to the normal schedule....

# From Paul Eggert (2007-03-02):
# <http://www.granma.cubaweb.cu/english/news/art89.html>, dated yesterday,
# says Cuban clocks will advance at midnight on March 10.
# For lack of better information, assume Cuba will use US rules,
# except that it switches at midnight standard time as usual.
#
# From Steffen Thorsen (2007-10-25):

# earlier - on the last Sunday of October, just like in 2006.

# I'm in Maryland which is now observing United States Eastern Daylight
# Time. At 9:44 local time I used RealPlayer to listen to
# http://media.enet.cu/radioreloj
# a Cuban information station, and heard
# the time announced as "ocho cuarenta y cuatro" ("eight forty-four"),
# indicating that Cuba is still on standard time.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-03-12):
# It seems that Cuba will start DST on Sunday, 2007-03-16...
# It was announced yesterday, according to this source (in Spanish):
# http://www.nnc.cubaweb.cu/marzo-2008/cien-1-11-3-08.htm
#
# Some more background information is posted here:
# https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/cuba-starts-dst-march-16.html
#
# The article also says that Cuba has been observing DST since 1963,
# while Shanks (and tzdata) has 1965 as the first date (except in the
# 1940's). Many other web pages in Cuba also claim that it has been
# observed since 1963, but with the exception of 1970 - an exception
# which is not present in tzdata/Shanks. So there is a chance we need to
# change some historic records as well.
#
# One example:
# http://www.radiohc.cu/espanol/noticias/mar07/11mar/hor.htm

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2008-03-13):
# The Cuban time change has just been confirmed on the most authoritative
# web site, the Granma.  Please check out
# http://www.granma.cubaweb.cu/2008/03/13/nacional/artic10.html
#
# Basically as expected after Steffen Thorsen's information, the change
# will take place midnight between Saturday and Sunday.

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-03-12):
# Assume Sun>=15 (third Sunday) going forward.

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2009-03-04)
# According to the Radio Reloj - Cuba will start Daylight Saving Time on
# midnight between Saturday, March 07, 2009 and Sunday, March 08, 2009-
# not on midnight March 14 / March 15 as previously thought.
#
# http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_cuba05.html
# (in Spanish)

# From Arthur David Olson (2009-03-09)
# I listened over the Internet to
# http://media.enet.cu/readioreloj
# this morning; when it was 10:05 a. m. here in Bethesda, Maryland the
# the time was announced as "diez cinco" - the same time as here, indicating
# that has indeed switched to DST. Assume second Sunday from 2009 forward.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2011-03-08):
# Granma announced that Cuba is going to start DST on 2011-03-20 00:00:00
# this year. Nothing about the end date known so far (if that has
# changed at all).

# From Rives McDow (2000-12-01):
# Dominican Republic changed its mind and presidential decree on Tuesday,
# November 28, 2000, with a new decree.  On Sunday, December 3 at 1:00 AM the
# Dominican Republic will be reverting to 8 hours from the International Date
# Line, and will not be using DST in the foreseeable future.  The reason they
# decided to use DST was to be in synch with Puerto Rico, who was also going
# to implement DST.  When Puerto Rico didn't implement DST, the president
# decided to revert.

# Haiti
# From Gwillim Law (2005-04-15):
# Risto O. Nykänen wrote me that Haiti is now on DST.
# I searched for confirmation, and I found a press release
# on the Web page of the Haitian Consulate in Chicago (2005-03-31),
# <http://www.haitianconsulate.org/time.doc>.  Translated from French, it says:
#
#  "The Prime Minister's Communication Office notifies the public in general
#   and the press in particular that, following a decision of the Interior
#   Ministry and the Territorial Collectivities [I suppose that means the
#   provinces], Haiti will move to Eastern Daylight Time in the night from next
#   Saturday the 2nd to Sunday the 3rd.
#
#  "Consequently, the Prime Minister's Communication Office wishes to inform
#   the population that the country's clocks will be set forward one hour
#   starting at midnight.  This provision will hold until the last Saturday in
#   October 2005.
#
#  "Port-au-Prince, March 31, 2005"
#
# From Steffen Thorsen (2006-04-04):
# I have been informed by users that Haiti observes DST this year like
# last year, so the current "only" rule for 2005 might be changed to a
# "max" rule or to last until 2006. (Who knows if they will observe DST
# next year or if they will extend their DST like US/Canada next year).
#
# I have found this article about it (in French):
# http://www.haitipressnetwork.com/news.cfm?articleID=7612
#
# The reason seems to be an energy crisis.

# From Stephen Colebourne (2007-02-22):
# Some IATA info: Haiti won't be having DST in 2007.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2012-03-11):
# According to several news sources, Haiti will observe DST this year,
# apparently using the same start and end date as USA/Canada.
# So this means they have already changed their time.
#
# http://www.alterpresse.org/spip.php?article12510
# http://radiovision2000haiti.net/home/?p=13253
#
# From Arthur David Olson (2012-03-11):
# The alterpresse.org source seems to show a US-style leap from 2:00 a.m. to
# 3:00 a.m. rather than the traditional Haitian jump at midnight.
# Assume a US-style fall back as well.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2013-03-10):
# It appears that Haiti is observing DST this year as well, same rules
# as US/Canada.  They did it last year as well, and it looks like they
# are going to observe DST every year now...

# Nicaragua
#
# This uses Shanks & Pottenger for times before 2005.
#
# From Steffen Thorsen (2005-04-12):
# I've got reports from 8 different people that Nicaragua just started
# DST on Sunday 2005-04-10, in order to save energy because of
# expensive petroleum.  The exact end date for DST is not yet
# announced, only "September" but some sites also say "mid-September".
# Some background information is available on the President's official site:
# http://www.presidencia.gob.ni/Presidencia/Files_index/Secretaria/Notas%20de%20Prensa/Presidente/2005/ABRIL/Gobierno-de-nicaragua-adelanta-hora-oficial-06abril.htm

# From Paul Eggert (2005-05-01):
# The decree doesn't say anything about daylight saving, but for now let's
# assume that it is daylight saving....
#
# From Gwillim Law (2005-04-21):
# The Associated Press story on the time change, which can be found at
# http://www.lapalmainteractivo.com/guias/content/gen/ap/America_Latina/AMC_GEN_NICARAGUA_HORA.html
# and elsewhere, says (fifth paragraph, translated from Spanish): "The last
# time that a change of clocks was applied to save energy was in the year 2000
# during the Arnoldo Alemán administration."...
# The northamerica file says that Nicaragua has been on UTC-6 continuously
# since December 1998.  I wasn't able to find any details of Nicaraguan time
# changes in 2000.  Perhaps a note could be added to the northamerica file, to
# the effect that we have indirect evidence that DST was observed in 2000.
#

# Turks and Caicos
#
# From Chris Dunn in
# https://bugs.debian.org/415007
# (2007-03-15): In the Turks & Caicos Islands (America/Grand_Turk) the
# daylight saving dates for time changes have been adjusted to match
# the recent U.S. change of dates.
#
# From Brian Inglis (2007-04-28):
# http://www.turksandcaicos.tc/calendar/index.htm [2007-04-26]
# there is an entry for Nov 4 "Daylight Savings Time Ends 2007" and three
# rows before that there is an out of date entry for Oct:
# "Eastern Standard Times Begins 2007
# Clocks are set back one hour at 2:00 a.m. local Daylight Saving Time"
# indicating that the normal ET rules are followed.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-08-19):
# The 2014-08-13 Cabinet meeting decided to stay on UT -04 year-round.  See:
# http://tcweeklynews.com/daylight-savings-time-to-be-maintained-p5353-127.htm
# Model this as a switch from EST/EDT to AST ...
# From Chris Walton (2014-11-04):
# ... the TCI government appears to have delayed the switch to
# "permanent daylight saving time" by one year....
# http://tcweeklynews.com/time-change-to-go-ahead-this-november-p5437-127.htm
#
# From the Turks & Caicos Cabinet (2017-07-20), heads-up from Steffen Thorsen:
# ... agreed to the reintroduction in TCI of Daylight Saving Time (DST)
# during the summer months and Standard Time, also known as Local
# Time, during the winter months with effect from April 2018 ...
# https://www.gov.uk/government/news/turks-and-caicos-post-cabinet-meeting-statement--3
# From Paul Eggert (2017-08-26):
# The date of effect of the spring 2018 change appears to be March 11,
# which makes more sense.  See: Hamilton D. Time change back
# by March 2018 for TCI. Magnetic Media. 2017-08-25.

# Standard Time Declaration Order 2015 (L.N. 15/2015)
# http://online.fliphtml5.com/fizd/czin/#p=2
#
# Standard Time Declaration Order 2017 (L.N. 31/2017)
# http://online.fliphtml5.com/fizd/dmcu/#p=2
#
# From Tim Parenti (2020-12-05):
# Although L.N. 31/2017 reads that it "shall come into operation at 2:00 a.m.
# on 11th March 2018", a precise interpretation here poses some problems.  The
# order states that "the standard time to be observed throughout the Turks and
# Caicos Islands shall be the same time zone as the Eastern United States of
# America" and further clarifies "[f]or the avoidance of doubt" that it
# "applies to the Eastern Standard Time as well as any changes thereto for
# Daylight Saving Time."  However, as clocks in Turks and Caicos approached
# 02:00 -04, and thus the declared implementation time, it was still 01:00 EST
# (-05), as DST in the Eastern US would not start until an hour later.
#
# Since it is unlikely that those on the islands switched their clocks twice in
# the span of an hour, we assume instead that the adoption of EDT actually took
# effect once clocks in the Eastern US had sprung forward, from 03:00 -04.
# This discrepancy only affects the time zone abbreviation and DST flag for the
# intervening hour, not wall clock times, as -04 was maintained throughout.

#
# From Fabián L. Arce Jofré (2000-04-04):
# The law that claimed DST for Argentina was derogated by President Fernando

# The following eight (8) provinces pulled clocks back to UTC-04:00 at

# From Mariano Absatz (2004-06-14):
# ... this weekend, the Province of Tucumán decided it'd go back to UTC-03:00

#
# From Gwillim Law (2004-06-14):
# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/04/06/10/de_609078.asp ...
#     "The time change in Tierra del Fuego was a conflicted decision from
#   the start.  The government had decreed that the measure would take
#   effect on June 1, but a normative error forced the new time to begin
#   three days earlier, from a Saturday to a Sunday....
# Our understanding was that the change was originally scheduled to take place
# on June 1 at 00:00 in Chubut, Santa Cruz, Tierra del Fuego (and some other
# provinces).  Sunday was May 30, only two days earlier.  So the article
# contains a contradiction.  I would give more credence to the Saturday/Sunday
# date than the "three days earlier" phrase, and conclude that Tierra del
# Fuego set its clocks back at 2004-05-30 00:00.
#
# From Steffen Thorsen (2004-10-05):
# The previous law 7210 which changed the province of Mendoza's time zone

# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-01-17):
# Here are articles that Argentina Province San Luis is planning to end DST

#
# Provincia argentina retrasa reloj y marca diferencia con resto del país
# (Argentine Province delayed clock and mark difference with the rest of the

# http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_argentina02.html

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2008-01-18):
# The page of the San Luis provincial government
# http://www.sanluis.gov.ar/notas.asp?idCanal=0&id=22812
# confirms what Alex Krivenyshev has earlier sent to the tz
# emailing list about that San Luis plans to return to standard
# time much earlier than the rest of the country. It also
# confirms that upon request the provinces San Juan and Mendoza
# refused to follow San Luis in this change.
#
# The change is supposed to take place Monday the 21st at 0:00
# hours. As far as I understand it if this goes ahead, we need
# a new timezone for San Luis (although there are also documented
# independent changes in the southamerica file of San Luis in
# 1990 and 1991 which has not been confirmed).

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2008-01-25):
# Unfortunately the below page has become defunct, about the San Luis
# time change. Perhaps because it now is part of a group of pages "Most
# important pages of 2008."
#
# You can use
# http://www.sanluis.gov.ar/notas.asp?idCanal=8141&id=22834
# instead it seems. Or use "Buscador" from the main page of the San Luis
# government, and fill in "huso" and click OK, and you will get 3 pages
# from which the first one is identical to the above.

# From Mariano Absatz (2008-01-28):
# I can confirm that the Province of San Luis (and so far only that
# province) decided to go back to UTC-3 effective midnight Jan 20th 2008
# (that is, Monday 21st at 0:00 is the time the clocks were delayed back
# 1 hour), and they intend to keep UTC-3 as their timezone all year round
# (that is, unless they change their mind any minute now).
#
# So we'll have to add yet another city to 'southamerica' (I think San
# Luis city is the mos populated city in the Province, so it'd be
# America/Argentina/San_Luis... of course I can't remember if San Luis's
# history of particular changes goes along with Mendoza or San Juan :-(
# (I only remember not being able to collect hard facts about San Luis
# back in 2004, when these provinces changed to UTC-4 for a few days, I
# mailed them personally and never got an answer).

# From Paul Eggert (2014-08-12):
# Unless otherwise specified, data entries are from Shanks & Pottenger through
# 1992, from the IATA otherwise.  As noted below, Shanks & Pottenger say that
# America/Cordoba split into 6 subregions during 1991/1992, one of which
# was America/San_Luis, but we haven't verified this yet so for now we'll
# keep America/Cordoba a single region rather than splitting it into the
# other 5 subregions.

# From Mariano Absatz (2009-03-13):
# Yesterday (with our usual 2-day notice) the Province of San Luis
# decided that next Sunday instead of "staying" @utc-03:00 they will go
# to utc-04:00 until the second Saturday in October...
#
# The press release is at
# http://www.sanluis.gov.ar/SL/Paginas/NoticiaDetalle.asp?TemaId=1&InfoPrensaId=3102
# (I couldn't find the decree, but www.sanluis.gov.ar
# is the official page for the Province Government.)
#
# There's also a note in only one of the major national papers ...
# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1107912
#
# The press release says [quick and dirty translation]:
# ... announced that next Sunday, at 00:00, Puntanos (the San Luis
# inhabitants) will have to turn back one hour their clocks
#
# Since then, San Luis will establish its own Province timezone. Thus,
# during 2009, this timezone change will run from 00:00 the third Sunday
# in March until 24:00 of the second Saturday in October.

# From Mariano Absatz (2009-10-16):
# ...the Province of San Luis is a case in itself.
#
# The Law at
# http://www.diputadossanluis.gov.ar/diputadosasp/paginas/verNorma.asp?NormaID=276
# is ambiguous because establishes a calendar from the 2nd Sunday in
# October at 0:00 thru the 2nd Saturday in March at 24:00 and the
# complement of that starting on the 2nd Sunday of March at 0:00 and
# ending on the 2nd Saturday of March at 24:00.
#
# This clearly breaks every time the 1st of March or October is a Sunday.
#
# IMHO, the "spirit of the Law" is to make the changes at 0:00 on the 2nd
# Sunday of October and March.
#
# The problem is that the changes in the rest of the Provinces that did
# change in 2007/2008, were made according to the Federal Law and Decrees
# that did so on the 3rd Sunday of October and March.
#
# In fact, San Luis actually switched from UTC-4 to UTC-3 last Sunday
# (October 11th) at 0:00.
#
# So I guess a new set of rules, besides "Arg", must be made and the last
# America/Argentina/San_Luis entries should change to use these...
# ...

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2010-04-09):
# According to news reports from El Diario de la República Province San
# Luis, Argentina (standard time UTC-04) will keep Daylight Saving Time
# after April 11, 2010 - will continue to have same time as rest of
# Argentina (UTC-3) (no DST).
#
# Confirmaron la prórroga del huso horario de verano (Spanish)
# http://www.eldiariodelarepublica.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=29383&Itemid=9
# or (some English translation):
# http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_argentina08.html

# From Mariano Absatz (2010-04-12):
# yes...I can confirm this...and given that San Luis keeps calling
# UTC-03:00 "summer time", we should't just let San Luis go back to "Arg"
# rules...San Luis is still using "Western ARgentina Time" and it got
# stuck on Summer daylight savings time even though the summer is over.

# From Paul Eggert (2018-01-23):
# Perhaps San Luis operates on the legal fiction that it is at -04
# with perpetual daylight saving time, but ordinary usage typically seems to
# just say it's at -03; see, for example,
# https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hora_oficial_argentina
# We've documented similar situations as being plain changes to
# standard time, so let's do that here too.  This does not change UTC
# offsets, only tm_isdst and the time zone abbreviations.  One minor
# plus is that this silences a zic complaint that there's no POSIX TZ
# setting for timestamps past 2038.

# Brazil

# From Paul Eggert (1993-11-18):
# The mayor of Rio recently attempted to change the time zone rules
# just in his city, in order to leave more summer time for the tourist trade.
# The rule change lasted only part of the day;
# the federal government refused to follow the city's rules, and business
# was in a chaos, so the mayor backed down that afternoon.

# From IATA SSIM (1996-02):
# _Only_ the following states in BR1 observe DST: Rio Grande do Sul (RS),
# Santa Catarina (SC), Paraná (PR), São Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ),
# Espírito Santo (ES), Minas Gerais (MG), Bahia (BA), Goiás (GO),
# Distrito Federal (DF), Tocantins (TO), Sergipe [SE] and Alagoas [AL].
# [The last three states are new to this issue of the IATA SSIM.]

# From Gwillim Law (1996-10-07):
# Geography, history (Tocantins was part of Goiás until 1989), and other
# sources of time zone information lead me to believe that AL, SE, and TO were
# always in BR1, and so the only change was whether or not they observed DST....
# The earliest issue of the SSIM I have is 2/91.  Each issue from then until
# 9/95 says that DST is observed only in the ten states I quoted from 9/95,
# along with Mato Grosso (MT) and Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), which are in BR2
# (UTC-4)....  The other two time zones given for Brazil are BR3, which is
# UTC-5, no DST, and applies only in the state of Acre (AC); and BR4, which is
# UTC-2, and applies to Fernando de Noronha (formerly FN, but I believe it's
# become part of the state of Pernambuco).  The boundary between BR1 and BR2
# has never been clearly stated.  They've simply been called East and West.
# However, some conclusions can be drawn from another IATA manual: the Airline
# Coding Directory, which lists close to 400 airports in Brazil.  For each
# airport it gives a time zone which is coded to the SSIM.  From that
# information, I'm led to conclude that the states of Amapá (AP), Ceará (CE),
# Maranhão (MA), Paraíba (PR), Pernambuco (PE), Piauí (PI), and Rio Grande do
# Norte (RN), and the eastern part of Pará (PA) are all in BR1 without DST.

# From Marcos Tadeu (1998-09-27):
# Brazilian official page <http://pcdsh01.on.br/verao1.html>

# From Jesper Nørgaard (2000-11-03):
# [For an official list of which regions in Brazil use which time zones, see:]
# http://pcdsh01.on.br/Fusbr.htm
# http://pcdsh01.on.br/Fusbrhv.htm

# From Celso Doria via David Madeo (2002-10-09):
# The reason for the delay this year has to do with elections in Brazil.
#
# Unlike in the United States, elections in Brazil are 100% computerized and
# the results are known almost immediately.  Yesterday, it was the first
# round of the elections when 115 million Brazilians voted for President,
# Governor, Senators, Federal Deputies, and State Deputies.  Nobody is
# counting (or re-counting) votes anymore and we know there will be a second
# round for the Presidency and also for some Governors.  The 2nd round will
# take place on October 27th.
#
# The reason why the DST will only begin November 3rd is that the thousands
# of electoral machines used cannot have their time changed, and since the
# Constitution says the elections must begin at 8:00 AM and end at 5:00 PM,
# the Government decided to postpone DST, instead of changing the Constitution
# (maybe, for the next elections, it will be possible to change the clock)...

# From Rodrigo Severo (2004-10-04):
# It's just the biannual change made necessary by the much hyped, supposedly
# modern Brazilian ... voting machines which, apparently, can't deal
# with a time change between the first and the second rounds of the elections.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2007-09-20):
# Brazil will start DST on 2007-10-14 00:00 and end on 2008-02-17 00:00:
# http://www.mme.gov.br/site/news/detail.do;jsessionid=BBA06811AFCAAC28F0285210913513DA?newsId=13975

# From Paul Schulze (2008-06-24):
# ...by law number 11.662 of April 24, 2008 (published in the "Diario
# Oficial da União"...) in Brazil there are changes in the timezones,
# effective today (00:00am at June 24, 2008) as follows:
#
# a) The timezone UTC+5 is extinguished, with all the Acre state and the
# part of the Amazonas state that had this timezone now being put to the
# timezone UTC+4
# b) The whole Pará state now is put at timezone UTC+3, instead of just
# part of it, as was before.
#
# This change follows a proposal of senator Tiao Viana of Acre state, that
# proposed it due to concerns about open television channels displaying
# programs inappropriate to youths in the states that had the timezone
# UTC+5 too early in the night. In the occasion, some more corrections
# were proposed, trying to unify the timezones of any given state. This
# change modifies timezone rules defined in decree 2.784 of 18 June,
# 1913.

# From Rodrigo Severo (2008-06-24):
# Just correcting the URL:
# https://www.in.gov.br/imprensa/visualiza/index.jsp?jornal=do&secao=1&pagina=1&data=25/04/2008
#
# As a result of the above Decree I believe the America/Rio_Branco
# timezone shall be modified from UTC-5 to UTC-4 and a new timezone shall
# be created to represent the...west side of the Pará State. I
# suggest this new timezone be called Santarem as the most
# important/populated city in the affected area.
#
# This new timezone would be the same as the Rio_Branco timezone up to
# the 2008/06/24 change which would be to UTC-3 instead of UTC-4.

# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-06-24):
# This is a quick reference page for New and Old Brazil Time Zones map.
# http://www.worldtimezone.com/brazil-time-new-old.php
#
# - 4 time zones replaced by 3 time zones - eliminating time zone UTC-05
# (state Acre and the part of the Amazonas will be UTC/GMT-04) - western
# part of Par state is moving to one timezone UTC-03 (from UTC-04).

# From Paul Eggert (2002-10-10):
# The official decrees referenced below are mostly taken from
# Decretos sobre o Horário de Verão no Brasil.
# http://pcdsh01.on.br/DecHV.html

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-08-29):
# As announced by the government and many newspapers in Brazil late
# yesterday, Brazil will start DST on 2008-10-19 (need to change rule) and
# it will end on 2009-02-15 (current rule for Brazil is fine). Based on
# past years experience with the elections, there was a good chance that
# the start was postponed to November, but it did not happen this year.

# 1890 and rounds its UT offset to 70W40; guess that in practice this
# was the same offset as in 1916-1919.  It also says Pacific/Easter
# standardized on 109W22 in 1890; assume this didn't change the clocks.
#
# Dates for America/Santiago from 1910 to 2004 are primarily from
# the following source, cited by Oscar van Vlijmen (2006-10-08):
# [1] Chile Law
# http://www.webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/chile.html
# This contains a copy of this official table:

# https://web.archive.org/web/20080330200901/http://www.horaoficial.cl/cambio.htm
# [1] needs several corrections, though.
#
# The first set of corrections is from:
# [2] History of the Official Time of Chile
# http://www.horaoficial.cl/ing/horaof_ing.html (retrieved 2012-03-06).  See:

# A fancier Spanish version (requiring mouse-clicking) is at:
# http://www.horaoficial.cl/historia_hora.php
# Conflicts between [1] and [2] were resolved as follows:
#
#  - [1] says the 1910 transition was Jan 1, [2] says Jan 10 and cites
#    Boletín No. 1, Aviso No. 1 (1910).  Go with [2].
#
#  - [1] says SMT was -4:42:45, [2] says Chile's official time from
#    1916 to 1919 was -4:42:46.3, the meridian of Chile's National
#    Astronomical Observatory (OAN), then located in what is now
#    Quinta Normal in Santiago.  Go with [1], as this matches the meridian
#    referred to by the relevant Chilean laws to this day.
#
#  - [1] says the 1918 transition was Sep 1, [2] says Sep 10 and cites
#    Boletín No. 22, Aviso No. 129/1918 (1918-08-23).  Go with [2].
#
#  - [1] does not give times for transitions; assume they occur
#    at midnight mainland time, the current common practice.  However,
#    go with [2]'s specification of 23:00 for the 1947-05-21 transition.
#
# Another correction to [1] is from Jesper Nørgaard Welen, who
# wrote (2006-10-08), "I think that there are some obvious mistakes in
# the suggested link from Oscar van Vlijmen,... for instance entry 66
# says that GMT-4 ended 1990-09-12 while entry 67 only begins GMT-3 at
# 1990-09-15 (they should have been 1990-09-15 and 1990-09-16
# respectively), but anyhow it clears up some doubts too."
#
# Data for Pacific/Easter from 1910 through 1967 come from Shanks &
# Pottenger.  After that, for lack of better info assume
# Pacific/Easter is always two hours behind America/Santiago;
# this is known to work for DST transitions starting in 2008 and
# may well be true for earlier transitions.

# From Tim Parenti (2022-07-06):
# For a brief period of roughly six weeks in 1946, DST was only observed on an
# emergency basis in specific regions of central Chile; namely, "the national
# territory between the provinces of Coquimbo and Concepción, inclusive".
# This was enacted by Decree 3,891, dated 1946-07-13, and took effect
# 1946-07-14 24:00, advancing these central regions to -03.
# https://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/versiones-anteriores/do-h/19460715/#page/1
# The decree contemplated "[t]hat this advancement of the Official Time, even
# though it has been proposed for the cities of Santiago and Valparaíso only,
# must be agreed with that of other cities, due to the connection of various
# activities that require it, such as, for example, the operation of rail
# services".  It was originally set to expire after 30 days but was extended
# through 1946-08-31 by Decree 4,506, dated 1946-08-13.
# https://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/versiones-anteriores/do-h/19460814/#page/1
#
# Law Number 8,522, promulgated 1946-08-27, reunified Chilean clocks at their
# new "Summer Time" of -04, reckoned as that of "the meridian of the
# Astronomical Observatory of Lo Espejo, advanced by 42 minutes and 45
# seconds".  Although this law specified the new Summer Time to start on 1
# September each year, a special "transitional article" started it a few days
# early, as soon as the law took effect.  As the law was to take force "from
# the date of its publication in the 'Diario Oficial', which happened the
# following day, presume the change took place in Santiago and its environs
# from 24:00 -03 to 23:00 -04 on Wednesday 1946-08-28.  Although this was a
# no-op for wall clocks in the north and south of the country, put their formal
# start to DST an hour later when they reached 24:00 -04.
# https://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/versiones-anteriores/do-h/19460828/#page/1
# After a brief "Winter Time" stint at -05 beginning 1947-04-01, Law Number
# 8,777, promulgated 1947-05-17, established year-round -04 "from 23:00 on the
# second day after it is published in the 'Diario Oficial'."  It was published
# on Monday 1947-05-19 and so took effect from Wednesday 1947-05-21 23:00.
# https://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/versiones-anteriores/do-h/19470519/#page/1

# From Eduardo Krell (1995-10-19):
# The law says to switch to DST at midnight [24:00] on the second SATURDAY
# of October....  The law is the same for March and October.
# (1998-09-29):
# Because of the drought this year, the government decided to go into
# DST earlier (saturday 9/26 at 24:00). This is a one-time change only ...
# (unless there's another dry season next year, I guess).

# From Julio I. Pacheco Troncoso (1999-03-18):
# Because of the same drought, the government decided to end DST later,
# on April 3, (one-time change).

# From Germán Poo-Caamaño (2008-03-03):
# Due to drought, Chile extends Daylight Time in three weeks.  This
# is one-time change (Saturday 3/29 at 24:00 for America/Santiago
# and Saturday 3/29 at 22:00 for Pacific/Easter)

# From Mauricio Parada (2012-02-22), translated by Glenn Eychaner (2012-02-23):
# As stated in the website of the Chilean Energy Ministry
# http://www.minenergia.cl/ministerio/noticias/generales/gobierno-anuncia-fechas-de-cambio-de.html
# The Chilean Government has decided to postpone the entrance into winter time
# (to leave DST) from March 11 2012 to April 28th 2012....
# Quote from the website communication:
#
# 6. For the year 2012, the dates of entry into winter time will be as follows:
# a. Saturday April 28, 2012, clocks should go back 60 minutes; that is, at
# 23:59:59, instead of passing to 0:00, the time should be adjusted to be 23:00
# of the same day.
# b. Saturday, September 1, 2012, clocks should go forward 60 minutes; that is,
# at 23:59:59, instead of passing to 0:00, the time should be adjusted to be
# 01:00 on September 2.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2013-02-15):
# According to several news sources, Chile has extended DST this year,
# they will end DST later and start DST earlier than planned.  They
# hope to save energy.  The new end date is 2013-04-28 00:00 and new
# start date is 2013-09-08 00:00....

# From Juan Correa (2016-03-18):
# The decree regarding DST has been published in today's Official Gazette...

# From Paul Eggert (2016-03-18):
# The decree says transitions occur at 24:00; in practice this appears

# It keeps the same time as Punta Arenas, Chile, because, just like us
# and the South Pole, that's the other end of their supply line....
# I verified with someone who was there that since 1980,
# Palmer has followed Chile.  Prior to that, before the Falklands War,
# Palmer used to be supplied from Argentina.

# This says President Sixto Durán Ballén signed decree No. 285, which
# established DST from 1992-11-28 to 1993-02-05; it does not give transition
# times.  The people called it "hora de Sixto" ("Sixto hour").  The change did
# not go over well; a popular song "Qué hora es" by Jaime Guevara had lyrics
# that included "Amanecía en mitad de la noche, los guaguas iban a clase sin
# sol" ("It was dawning in the middle of the night, the buses went to class
# without sun").  Although Ballén's campaign slogan was "Ni un paso atrás"
# (Not one step back), the clocks went back in 1993 and the experiment was not
# repeated.  For now, assume transitions were at 00:00 local time country-wide.

# Falklands

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Between 1990 and 2000 inclusive, Shanks & Pottenger and the IATA agree except
# the IATA gives 1996-09-08.  Go with Shanks & Pottenger.

# From Falkland Islands Government Office, London (2001-01-22)
# via Jesper Nørgaard:
# ... the clocks revert back to Local Mean Time at 2 am on Sunday 15
# April 2001 and advance one hour to summer time at 2 am on Sunday 2
# September.  It is anticipated that the clocks will revert back at 2
# am on Sunday 21 April 2002 and advance to summer time at 2 am on
# Sunday 1 September.

# From Rives McDow (2001-02-13):
#
# I have communicated several times with people there, and the last
# time I had communications that was helpful was in 1998.  Here is
# what was said then:
#
# "The general rule was that Stanley used daylight saving and the Camp
# did not. However for various reasons many people in the Camp have
# started to use daylight saving (known locally as 'Stanley Time')
# There is no rule as to who uses daylight saving - it is a matter of
# personal choice and so it is impossible to draw a map showing who
# uses it and who does not. Any list would be out of date as soon as
# it was produced. This year daylight saving ended on April 18/19th
# and started again on September 12/13th.  I do not know what the rule
# is, but can find out if you like.  We do not change at the same time
# as UK or Chile."
#
# I did have in my notes that the rule was "Second Saturday in Sep at
# 0:00 until third Saturday in Apr at 0:00".  I think that this does
# not agree in some cases with Shanks; is this true?
#
# Also, there is no mention in the list that some areas in the
# Falklands do not use DST.  I have found in my communications there
# that these areas are on the western half of East Falkland and all of
# West Falkland.  Stanley is the only place that consistently observes
# DST.  Again, as in other places in the world, the farmers don't like
# it.  West Falkland is almost entirely sheep farmers.
#
# I know one lady there that keeps a list of which farm keeps DST and
# which doesn't each year.  She runs a shop in Stanley, and says that
# the list changes each year.  She uses it to communicate to her
# customers, catching them when they are home for lunch or dinner.

# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-05):
# For now, we'll just record the time in Stanley, since we have no
# better info.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2011-04-01):
# The Falkland Islands will not turn back clocks this winter, but stay on
# daylight saving time.
#
# One source:
# http://www.falklandnews.com/public/story.cfm?get=5914&source=3
#
# We have gotten this confirmed by a clerk of the legislative assembly:
# Normally the clocks revert to Local Mean Time (UTC/GMT -4 hours) on the
# third Sunday of April at 0200hrs and advance to Summer Time (UTC/GMT -3
# hours) on the first Sunday of September at 0200hrs.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: During 2011, on a trial basis, the Falkland Islands
# will not revert to local mean time, but clocks will remain on Summer
# time (UTC/GMT - 3 hours) throughout the whole of 2011.  Any long term
# change to local time following the trial period will be notified.
#
# From Andrew Newman (2012-02-24)
# A letter from Justin McPhee, Chief Executive,
# Cable & Wireless Falkland Islands (dated 2012-02-22)
# states...
#   The current Atlantic/Stanley entry under South America expects the
#   clocks to go back to standard Falklands Time (FKT) on the 15th April.
#   The database entry states that in 2011 Stanley was staying on fixed
#   summer time on a trial basis only.  FIG need to contact IANA and/or
#   the maintainers of the database to inform them we're adopting
#   the same policy this year and suggest recommendations for future years.
#
# For now we will assume permanent -03 for the Falklands
# until advised differently (to apply for 2012 and beyond, after the 2011
# experiment was apparently successful.)

# The text of the law says that it enters into force on the first

# prohibits retroactive effect, and the civil code says that laws
# enter into force on the day after their publication or on the day
# that they specify, and it also says that they don't have retroactive
# effect.  So I think that the time change on 6 October 2024 should

# Page 36 of Almanaque 2018, published by the Oceanography, Hydrography, and

# http://www.impo.com.uy/diariooficial/
#
# Ley No. 3920 of 1908-06-10 placed the determination of legal time under the
# auspices of the National Institute for the Prediction of Time.  It is unclear
# exactly what offset was used during this period, though Ley No. 7200 of
# 1920-04-23 used the Observatory of the National Meteorological Institute in
# Montevideo (34° 54' 33" S, 56° 12' 45" W) as its reference meridian,
# retarding legal time by 15 minutes 9 seconds from 1920-04-30 24:00,
# resulting in UT-04.  Assume the corresponding LMT of UT-03:44:51 (given on
# page 725 of the Proceedings of the Second Pan-American Scientific Congress,
# 1915-1916) was in use, and merely became official from 1908-06-10.

# minutes 51 seconds (UT-03:30) "the rest of the year"; a message from the

# From Tim Parenti (2018-02-15):
# http://www.impo.com.uy/diariooficial/1933/10/27/6
#
# It appears Ley No. 9122 of 1933 was never published as such in the Diario
# Oficial, but instead appeared as Document 26 in the Diario on Friday
# 1933-10-27 as a decree made Monday 1933-10-23 and filed under the Ministry of
# National Defense.  It reinstituted a DST of 30 minutes (to UT-03) "from the
# last Sunday of October...until the last Saturday of March."  In accordance
# with this provision, the first transition was explicitly specified in Article
# 2 of the decree as Saturday 1933-10-28 at 24:00; that is, Sunday 1933-10-29
# at 00:00.  Assume transitions at 00:00 Sunday throughout.
#
# Departing from the matter-of-fact nature of previous timekeeping laws, the
# 1933 decree "consider[s] the advantages of...the advance of legal time":
#
#   "Whereas: The measure adopted by almost all nations at the time of the last
#    World War still persists in North America and Europe, precisely because of
#    the economic, hygienic, and social advantages derived from such an
#    emergency measure...
#
#    Whereas: The advance of the legal time during the summer seasons, by
#    displacing social activity near sunrise, favors the citizen populations
#    and especially the society that creates and works..."
#
# It further specified that "necessary measures" be taken to ensure that
# "public spectacles finish, in general, before [01:00]."

# From Tim Parenti (2018-02-15):
# Most of the Rules below, and their contemporaneous Zone lines, have been
# updated simply to match the Almanaque 2018.  Although the document does not
# list exact transition times, midnight transitions were already present in our
# data here for all transitions through 2004-09, and this is both consistent
# with prior transitions and verified in several decrees marked below between
# 1939-09 and 2004-09, wherein the relevant text was typically of the form:
#
#   "From 0 hours on [date], the legal time of the entire Republic will be...
#
#    In accordance with [the preceding], on [previous date] at 24 hours, all
#    clocks throughout the Republic will be [advanced/retarded] by..."
#
# It is possible that there is greater specificity to be found for the Rules
# below, but it is buried in no fewer than 40 different decrees individually
# referenced by the Almanaque for the period from 1939-09 to 2014-09.
# Four-fifths of these were promulgated less than two weeks before taking
# effect; more than half within a week and none more than 5 weeks.  Only the
# handful with comments below have been checked with any thoroughness.

# tzdb data for ships at sea and other miscellany

# This file is in the public domain, so clarified as of
# 2009-05-17 by Arthur David Olson.

# These entries are for uses not otherwise covered by the tz database.
# Their main practical use is for platforms like Android that lack
# support for POSIX proleptic TZ strings.  On such platforms these entries
# can be useful if the timezone database is wrong or if a ship or
# aircraft at sea is not in a timezone.

# Starting with POSIX 1003.1-2001, the entries below are all
# unnecessary as settings for the TZ environment variable.  E.g.,
# instead of TZ='Etc/GMT+4' one can use the POSIX setting TZ='<-04>+4'.
#
# Do not use a POSIX TZ setting like TZ='GMT+4', which is four hours
# behind GMT but uses the completely misleading abbreviation "GMT".

# The following zone is used by tzcode functions like gmtime,
# which load the "UTC" file to handle seconds properly.
Zone	Etc/UTC		0	-	UTC

# Functions like gmtime load the "GMT" file to handle leap seconds properly.
# Vanguard section, which works with most .zi parsers.
#Zone	GMT		0	-	GMT
# Rearguard section, for TZUpdater 2.3.2 and earlier.
Zone	Etc/GMT		0	-	GMT

# The following link uses older naming conventions,
# but it belongs here, not in the file 'backward',
# as it is needed for tzcode releases through 2022a,
# where functions like gmtime load "GMT" instead of the "Etc/UTC".
# We want this to work even on installations that omit 'backward'.
Link	Etc/GMT				GMT
# End of rearguard section.

# Be consistent with POSIX TZ settings in the Zone names,
# even though this is the opposite of what many people expect.
# POSIX has positive signs west of Greenwich, but many people expect
# positive signs east of Greenwich.  For example, TZ='Etc/GMT+4' uses
# the abbreviation "-04" and corresponds to 4 hours behind UT
# (i.e. west of Greenwich) even though many people would expect it to
# mean 4 hours ahead of UT (i.e. east of Greenwich).

# Earlier incarnations of this package were not POSIX-compliant,
# and had lines such as
#		Zone	GMT-12		-12	-	GMT-1200
# We did not want things to change quietly if someone accustomed to the old
# way does a
#		zic -l GMT-12
# so we moved the names into the Etc subdirectory.
# Also, the time zone abbreviations are now compatible with %z.

# There is no "Etc/Unknown" entry, as CLDR says that "Etc/Unknown"
# corresponds to an unknown or invalid time zone, and things would get
# confusing if Etc/Unknown were made valid here.

# tzdb data for noncommittal factory settings

# This file is in the public domain, so clarified as of
# 2009-05-17 by Arthur David Olson.

# For distributors who don't want to specify a timezone in their
# installation procedures.  Users who run 'date' will get the
# time zone abbreviation "-00", indicating that the actual time zone
# is unknown.

# TZ="Factory" was added to TZDB in 1989, and in 2016 its abbreviation
# was changed to "-00" from a longish English-language error message.
# Around 2010, CLDR added "Etc/Unknown" for use with TZDB, to stand
# for an unknown or invalid time zone.  These two notions differ:
# TZ="Factory" is a valid timezone, so tzalloc("Factory") succeeds, whereas
# TZ="Etc/Unknown" is invalid and tzalloc("Etc/Unknown") fails.
# Also, a downstream distributor could modify Factory to be a
# default timezone suitable for the devices it manufactures,
# whereas that cannot happen for Etc/Unknown.

# Links and zones for backward compatibility

# This file is in the public domain, so clarified as of
# 2009-05-17 by Arthur David Olson.

# This file provides links from old or merged timezone names to current ones.
# It also provides a few zone entries for old naming conventions.
# Many names changed in 1993 and in 1995, and many merged names moved here
# in the period from 2013 through 2022.  Several of these names are
# also present in the file 'backzone', which has data important only
# for pre-1970 timestamps and so is out of scope for tzdb proper.

# Although this file is optional and tzdb will work if you omit it by
# building with 'make BACKWARD=', in practice downstream users
# typically use this file for backward compatibility.

# This file is divided into sections, one for each major reason for a
# backward compatibility link.  Each section is sorted by link name.

# A "#= TARGET1" comment labels each link inserted only because some
# .zi parsers (including tzcode through 2022e) mishandle links to links.
# The comment says what the target would be if these parsers were fixed
# so that data could contain links to links.  For example, the line
# "Link Australia/Sydney Australia/ACT #= Australia/Canberra" would be
# "Link Australia/Canberra Australia/ACT" were it not that data lines
# refrain from linking to links like Australia/Canberra, which means
# the Australia/ACT line links instead to Australia/Sydney,
# Australia/Canberra's target.
