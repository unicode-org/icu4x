<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

Exposes the list of all known `DataMarker`s.

This is modeled as a macro that accepts a callback macro of the shape:

```rust
macro_rules! cb {
    ($($marker:path = $path:literal,)+ #[experimental] $($emarker:path = $epath:literal,)+) => {
        // Do something for each marker, or each experimental marker
    };
}
```

Calling this as `registry!(cb);` evaluates `cb` with the list of markers.
